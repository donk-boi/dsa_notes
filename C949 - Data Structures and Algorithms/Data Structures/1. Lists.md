### List ADT
- A **List** is a common ADT for holding ordered data having operations like append a data item, remove, a data item, search whether a data item exists, and print the list.
- **Common Operations for a list include:**

| Operation               | Description                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `Append(list,x)`        | Inserts x at the end of list              |
| `Prepend(list,x)`       | Inserts x at the start of list            |
| `InsertAfter(list,w,x)` | Inserts x at after w                      |
| `Remove(list,x)`        | Removes x                                 |
| `Search(list,x)`        | Returns item if found, else returns null  |
| `Print(list)`           | Prints list's items in order              |
| `PrintReverse(list)`    | Prints list's items in reverse order      |
| `Sort(list)`            | Sorts the list's items in ascending order |
| `IsEmpty(list)`         | Returns true if list has no items         |
| `GetLength(list)`       | Returns the number of items in the list   |
### List Data Structure
- A common approach for implementing a linked list is using two data structures:
	- **A List Data Structure** is a data structure containing the list's head and tail, and may also include additional information, such as the list's size.
	- **List Node Data Structure** maintains the data for each list element, including the element's data and pointers to other list elements.

### Singly-Linked List 
#### Singly-Linked List Data Structure:
- **A singly linked list** is a data structure for implementing a list ADT where each node has data and a pointer to the next node.
- The list structure typically has pointers to the list's first node and last node.
- The first node in a *singly-linked list* is called the **Head** 
- The last node is called the **Tail**
	- In a single node list, the **head and the tail are the same value**
- A *singly-linked list* is a type of **Positional List** 
	- Which is a list where elements contain pointers to the next and/or previous elements in the list.
- **Null** is a special valude indicating a pointer points to nothing
	- The name used to represent a pointer (or reference) that points to nothing varies between programming languages and includes **nil, nullptrm None, NULLn and even the value 0**
- *Append operation for a singly-linked list* inserts a new node after the list's tail node
	- *Append to empty list* if the list's head pointer is null, the algorithm points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node
	- *Append to non-empty list* if the head's pointer is not null, the algorithm points the tail node's next pointer and the list's tail pointer to a new node
- **Prepend** (given a new node) operation is for a singly-linked list which inserts a new node before the head node.
	- This behavior differs if the list is empty vs not empty
		- *Prepend to empty list* if the list's head pointer is null, the algorithm points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node.
		- *Prepend to non-empty list* if the list's head pointer is not null, the algorithm points the new node's next pointer to the head node, and then  points the list's head pointer to the new node.
### Linked List Search
- Given a key, a **Search**  algorithm returns the first node whose data matches that key, or returns null if a matching nodes was not found.
- A simple linked list search algorithm checks the current node (which initially is the head node of the list), returns that node if a match, else pointing the current node to the next node and repeating
- If the pointer to the current node is null, the algorithm returns null (matching node not found)

### Python: Singly Linked Lists
- **Constructing the Node and List Class**
	- In python, classes are used for both the linked list and the nodes that comprise the list
	- Each class includes references to nodes (next node for the `Node` class and head and tail nodes for the `LinkedList` Class)
	- The node class implements a list node with two data members, a data value and then next node in the list
		- If the node as no next node, the next data member is assigned with None, **Which is the python term signifying absence of a value**
	- The `LinkedList` class implements the list data structure and contains two data members:
		- Head and Tail whioch are assigned to nodes once the list is populated
		- Initially the list has no nodes, so both data members are initially assigned with None

##### Appending a Node to a Singly-Linked List
- The `append()` method is a method within the `LinkedList` class
- The `append()` method adds to a node to the end of a linked list, making the node the tail of the list
- The `append()` method has two parameters, the second of which is the new node to be appended to the list
	- Note that the definition for `append()` and all other class methods contain a self parameter
	- This parameter refers to the class object itself, and thus is not passed as an argument to the class methods.

##### Additional singly-linked list methods
- The following methods are implemented within the `LinkedList` class

### Doubly-Linked Lists
- **Doubly-Linked Lists** is a data structure for implementing a list ADT where each node has data, a pointer to the next node and **a pointer to the previous node**
- The list structure typically points to the firs and last nodes
- The doubly-linked list's first node is called the head and the last is called the tail
- A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list but instead of using a single pointer to the next node in the list, each node has a pointer to the next **AND** the previous nodes
	- This is a type of **Proportional List**
		- Which is a list where elements contain pointers to the next and/or the previous elements in the list
![[Pasted image 20250528120316.png]]
##### Appending a Node to a Doubly-Linked List
- Given a new node, the Append operations for a doubly linked list inserts a new node after the lists tail node
- The append algorithm behavior differs if the list is empty vs not empty
	- _Append to empty list:_ If the list's head pointer is null (empty), the algorithm points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node.
	- _Append to non-empty list:_ If the list's head pointer is not null (not empty), the algorithm points the tail node's next pointer to the new node, points the new node's previous pointer to the list's tail node, and points the list's tail pointer to the new node.

##### Prepending a Node to a Doubly-Linked List
- Given a new node, the **Prepend Operation** of a doubly linked list inserts the new node before the lists head and points the head pointer to the new node
	- _Prepend to empty list:_ If the list's head pointer is null (empty), the algorithm points the list's head and tail pointers to the new node.
	- _Prepend to non-empty list:_ If the list's head pointer is not null (not empty), the algorithm points the new node's next pointer to the list's head node, points the list head node's previous pointer to the new node, and then points the list's head pointer to the new node.

### Circular Lists
- A **Circular List** is a linked list where the tail nodes next pointer points to the head of the list
- Can be used to represent repeating processes
- The head of circular linked list is often referred to as the **Star Node**
