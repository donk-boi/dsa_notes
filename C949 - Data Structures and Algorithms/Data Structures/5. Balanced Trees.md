### AVL: A Balanced Tree
- An **AVL Tree** is a BST with a height property and specific operations to re balance the tree when the node is inserted or removed
- A nodes **Balance Factor** is the left subtree height minus the right subree height which is 1, 0 , or -1 in an AVL Tree

- Minimizing binary tree height yields fastest searches insertions and removals
- If nodes are inserted and removed dynamically, maintaining a minimum height tree requires extensive tree rearrangements
- In contrast **AVL Trees** only require few local rotations so more computationally efficient but doesn't guarantee a minimum height
	- Theoreticians have shown than an AVL Tree's worst case height is no worse than about 1.5x the minimum binary tree height so the height is still **O(logN)** where **N** is the number of nodes
		- Experiments have shown that AVL Tree heights in practice are much closer to the minimum

- **Storing Height at each AVL node**
- An AVL Tree implementation can store the subtree height as a member of each node
- Within the height stored as a member of each node, the balance factor for any node can be computed in **O(1)** time 
- When a node is inserted in or removed from an AVL Tree, ancestor nodes may need the height value to be recomputed
