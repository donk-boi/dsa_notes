### Graphs: Introduction
##### Introduction to Graphs
![[Pasted image 20250602182509.png]]
- A **Graph** is a data structure for representing connections among items, and consists of vertices connected by edges
	- A **Vertex** (or node) represents an item in a graph
	- An **Edge** represents connection between two vertices in a graph

##### Adjacency and Paths
- In a *Graph*
	- Two vertices are **Adjacent** if connected by an edge
	- A **Path** is a sequence of edges leading from a source (starting) vertex
		- The **Path Length** is the number of edges in the path
	- The **Distance** between two vertices is the number of edges on the shortest path between those vertices

### Applications of Graphs
##### Geographic Maps and Navigation
- Graphs are often used to represent a geographic map, which can contain information about places and travel routes
- Edge weights in such graphs often represent the length of a travel route either in total distance or expected time taken to navigate the route

##### Product Recommendations
- Graph can be used to represent relationships between produces
- The vertices in the graph corresponding to a customers purchased products have adjacent vertices representing products that can be recommended to the customer

##### Social and Professional Networks
- A graph may use a vertex to represent a person
- And edge in such graph represents a relationship between 2 people
	- In a graph representing a social network, and edge commonly represents friendship
	- In a graph representing a professional network, an edge commonly represents business conducted between two people

### Adjacency Lists
##### Adjacency Lists
- Various approaches exist for representing graph data structures.
- A common approach is an adjacency list
	- Two vertices are adjacent if connected by an edge
	- In an adjacency list graph representation, each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices, each list item representing an edge
![[Pasted image 20250602195939.png]]
##### Advantages of Adjacency Lists
- A key advantage is a size of **O(V + E)** because each vertex appears once, and each edge appears twice
	- **V** refers to number of vertices
	- **E** refers to number of edges
- However a disadvantage is that determining whether two vertices are adjacent is O(V) becuase once vertex's adjacency list must be traversed looking for the other vertex and that list could have V items 
- However in most applications, a vertex is only adjacent to a small fraction of other vertices, yielding a sparse graph.
	- A **Sparse Graph** has far fewer edges than the maximum possible
	- Many graphs are sparse like those representing a computer network or flights between cities, or friendships among people
	- Thus the adjacency list graph representation is very common

### Adjacency Matrices
##### Adjacency Matrices
- Various approaches exist for representing a graph data structure
- One approach is an **Adjacency Matrix**
	- Two vertices are adjacent if connected by an edge
	- In an **Adjacency Matrix Graph Representation** each vertex is assigned to a matrix row and column, and a matrix element is 1 if the corresponding two vertices have an edge or is 0 otherwise
![[Pasted image 20250602200907.png]]
##### Analysis of Adjacency Matrices
- Assuming the common implementation as a two-dimensional array whose elements are accessible in **O(1)** then an adjacency matrix's key benefit is **O(1)** determination of whether two vertices are adjacent.
- The corresponding element is just checked for 0 or 1
- A key drawback is **O(V^2)** size
	- i.e. A graph with 1000 vertices would require 1000 x 1000 matrix, meaning 1000000 elements
	- An adjacency matrix's largest size is inefficient for a sparse graph in which most elements would be 0s
- An adjacency matrix only represents edges among vertices; if each vertex has data, such as a persons name and address, then a separate list of elements of vertices is needed
### Python: Graphs
##### Building the Graph and Vertex Classes
- The Graph class holds a vertex adjacency list using a dictionary that maps a Vertex Object to a list of adjacent objects
- The Vertex class contains a label but can be augmented by graph algorithms to contain additional data if required
##### Graph and Vertex Classes
```python
class Vertex:
    def __init__(self, label):
        self.label = label
        
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.adjacency_list = {}
  
    def add_vertex(self, new_vertex):
        self.adjacency_list[new_vertex] = []
```
##### Adding Vertices to a Graph
```python
# Program to create and populate a Graph object.
g = Graph()
vertex_a = Vertex("New York")
vertex_b = Vertex("Tokyo")
vertex_c = Vertex("London")

g.add_vertex(vertex_a)
g.add_vertex(vertex_b)
g.add_vertex(vertex_c)
```
##### Graph Edges and Edge Weights
- Edges are represented as vertex *pairs* using a 2-items tuple
	- i.e. `vertex_a, vertex_b` is an edge that goes from `vertex_a` to `vertex_b`
- Undirected edges are two symmetric vertex pairs (`vertex_b, vertex_a` and `vertex_a, vertex_b`) 
- Edges also have numeric *weights* 
	- By default an edge is assigned with weight `1.0` 
	- Edge weights are sorted in the dictionary `edge_weights` where the vertex pair is the key and the edge weight is the value
		- i.e. The edge (`vertex_a, vertex_b`) is assigned with weight `3.7` by `self.edge_weights[(vertex_a, vertex_b)] = 3.7`
- The method `add_directed_edge()` is used to add edges to a graph
	- To store the edge (`vertex_a, vertex_b`) `vertex_b` is appended to `self.adjacency_list[vertex_a]` 
- The method `add_undirected_edge()` calls `add_directed_edge()` twice to add both of the edge's symmetric versions.
- Both `add_directed_edge()` and `addd_undirected_edge()` use a default parameter for the edge's weight assigned with `1.0` if the methods are called without the last parameter
##### Graph Class Methods: `add_directed_edge()` and `add_undirected_edge()`
```python
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.adjacency_list = {}
        self.edge_weights = {}       
         
    def add_vertex(self, new_vertex):
        self.adjacency_list[new_vertex] = []
        
    def add_directed_edge(self, from_vertex, to_vertex, weight = 1.0):
        self.edge_weights[(from_vertex, to_vertex)] = weight
        self.adjacency_list[from_vertex].append(to_vertex)
        
    def add_undirected_edge(self, vertex_a, vertex_b, weight = 1.0):
        self.add_directed_edge(vertex_a, vertex_b, weight)
        self.add_directed_edge(vertex_b, vertex_a, weight)
```
##### A directed graph showing water flow through a system of pumping stations and a program to create the graph
- Graph with edges: 
	- Vertices (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) represent water pump stations
	- Edges represent water flow from one station to another 
	- Edge weights indicating the capacity of flow that is possible along that route

g.add_directed_edge(vertex_b, vertex_e, 11)
g.add_directed_edge(vertex_e, vertex_c, 23)

```

- Graph with undirected edges
	- Vertices are cities
	- Edges represent flights between the cities
	- Edge weight represent the miles between the cities
