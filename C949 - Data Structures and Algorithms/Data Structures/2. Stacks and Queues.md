### Stack Abstract Data Type (ADT)
- **Stack ADT
	- A **Stack** is an ADT which items are only inserted or removed from the top of the stack.
	- The *Stack **Push*** operation inserts an item on the top of the stack.
	- The *Stack **Pop*** operation removed and returns the items at the top of the stack
		- i.e. after the operations `push 7` `push 14` `push 9` and `push 5`, *pop* returns `5` a second *pop* returns `9`
	- A **Stack** is referred to as a *last-in-first-out* ADT.
	- A stack can be implemented using a linked list, an array, or a vector.
- **Common Stack ADT Operations

| Operation          | Description                                      | Example with Stack: 99, 77                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Push(stack, x)`   | Inserts x on top of stack                        | `Push(stack, 44)`.` Stack: 44, 99, 77`        |
| `Pop(stack)`       | Returns and removes item at top of stack         | `Pop(stack)` returns: 99. Stack: 77           |
| `Peek(stack)`      | Returns but does not remove item at top of stack | `Peek(stack)` returns 99. Stack still: 99, 77 |
| `IsEmpty(stack)`   | eturns true if stack has no items                | `IsEmpty(stack)` returns false.               |
| `GetLength(stack)` | Returns the number of items in the stack         | `GetLength(stack)` returns 2.                 |
- *Note: `Pop` and `Peek` operations should not be applied to an empty stack; the resulting behavior may be undefined.*
### Stacks Using Linked Lists
See [[1. Lists]]
- A Stack is often implemented using a **Linked List** with the lists head node being the stacks top
- A **push** is performed by creating a new list node assigning the nodes data with the item and prepending the node to the list
- A **pop** is performed by assigning a local variable with the head nodes data, removing the head node from the list and then returning the local variable

### Python: Array Based Stacks
- A Stack can be implemented with an array, two variables are needed in addition to the array:
	- `allocationSize`: an integer for the arrays allocated size
	- `length`: an integer for the stacks length
- The stacks bottom item is at `array[0]` and the top item is at `array[length - 1]` 
	- if the stack is empty, the length is 0

##### Unbounded Stack
- An **Unbounded Stack** is a stack with no upper limit on length
- An unbounded stack's length can increase indefinitely so the stacks array allocation size must also be able to increase indefinitely

![[Pasted image 20250528124252.png]]
##### Bounded Stack
- A **Bounded Stack** is a stack with a length that does not exceed a maximum value
- The max is commonly the initial allocations size 
	- i.e. A bounded stack with `allocationSize = 100` cannot exceed length of 100 items
- A bounded stack with a length equal to the max length is said to be **Full**

##### Implementing a stack with a python list
- Operations presented above work under the assumption that arrays have a fixed size and so reallocation is needed for some push operations
- Fixed size arrays are common in several popular programming languages and so the approach described above works in each
- The stack class implementation that follows uses a Python List
- **Python Lists do not have a fixed size so implementing reallocation is not needed, therefore implementation is simpler than an implementation with a fixed array**

##### Implementing the stack class to support bounded or unbounded functionality
- The stack class below can be used as an unbounded stack or a bounded stack
- If the parameter passed to the constructor is negative, the stack is unbounded, whereas if its non-negative, the stack is bounded.

### Queue Abstract Data Type (ADT)
 - A **Queue** is an ADT in which items are inserted at the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue
 - The Queue **Enqueue** operation inserts an item at the end of the queue
 - The queue **Dequeue** operation removes and returns the item at the front of the queue
	 - A queue is referred to as a **First-In-First-Out** ADT
	 - A queue can be implemented using a linked list or an array
See [[1. Lists]], [[7. Lists and Dictionaries]]
##### Examples

##### Common ADT operations
|Operation|Description|Example starting with queue: 43, 12, 77 (front is 43)|
|---|---|---|
|Enqueue(queue, x)|Inserts x at end of the queue|Enqueue(queue, 56). Queue: 43, 12, 77, 56|
|Dequeue(queue)|Returns and removes item at front of queue|Dequeue(queue) returns: 43. Queue: 12, 77|
|Peek(queue)|Returns but does not remove item at the front of the queue|Peek(queue) return 43. Queue: 43, 12, 77|
|IsEmpty(queue)|Returns true if queue has no items|IsEmpty(queue) returns false.|
|GetLength(queue)|Returns the number of items in the queue|GetLength(queue) returns 3.|

### Deque ADT
- A  **Deque** which is pronounced as *'deck'*  and is short for double ended queue is an ADT in which items can be inserted and removed at both the front and the back
	- **Push-Front** operation inserts an item at the front
	- **Push-Back** operation inserts an item at the back
	- **Pop-Front** removes and returns the item at the front
	- **Pop-Back** removes and returns the item at the back

##### Common Deque ADT operations
- In addition to pushing or popping at the front or back, a deque typically supports peeking at the front and back and determining the length
	- A **Peek** operation returns an item in the deque without removing the item

| Operation           | Description                                                | Example starting with deque: 59, 63, 19 (front is 59)   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| PushFront(deque, x) | Inserts x at the front of the deque                        | PushFront(deque, 41). Deque: 41, 59, 63, 19             |
| PushBack(deque, x)  | Inserts x at the back of the deque                         | PushBack(deque, 41). Deque: 59, 63, 19, 41              |
| PopFront(deque)     | Returns and removes item at front of deque                 | PopFront(deque) returns 59. Deque: 63, 19               |
| PopBack(deque)      | Returns and removes item at back of deque                  | PopBack(deque) returns 19. Deque: 59, 63                |
| PeekFront(deque)    | Returns but does not remove the item at the front of deque | PeekFront(deque) returns 59. Deque is still: 59, 63, 19 |
| PeekBack(deque)     | Returns but does not remove the item at the back of deque  | PeekBack(deque) returns 19. Deque is still: 59, 63, 19  |
| IsEmpty(deque)      | Returns true if the deque is empty                         | IsEmpty(deque) returns false.                           |
| GetLength(deque)    | Returns the number of items in the deque                   | GetLength(deque) returns 3.                             |
