### Heaps
- Some applications require fast access to and removal of the maximum item in a changing set of items
	- i.e. a computer may execute jobs one at a time, upon finishing the job, the computer executes the pending job having maximum priority
	- 4 pending jobs have priorities 22, 14, 98, and 50; the computer should execute
		- **98, then 50, then 22, and then 14**
			- *New jobs may arrive at any time*
- Maintaining jobs in a fully sorted order requires more operations than necessary since the only maximum items is *needed*
- A **Max-Heap** is a complete *Binary Tree* that maintains the simple property that a node's key is greater than or equal to the node's children's keys
	- *A **Max Heap** may be any kind of tree but is more commonly a Binary Tree*

#### Max-Heap Insert and Remove Operations
- An **Insert** into a max-heap starts be inserting the node in the tree's last level and then swapping the node with its parent until no max-heap property violation occurs
	- Inserts fill a level (left to right) before adding another level so the trees height is always the minimum possible
	- The upward movement of a node in a max-heap is called **Percolating**
- A **Remove** from a max-heap is always a removal of the root and is done by replacing the root with the last level's last node and swapping that node with its greatest child until no max-heap property violation occurs
	- Because upon completion that node will occupy another node's location (which was swapped upwards) the trees height remains the minimum possible

#### Min-Heap
- A **Min-Heap** is similar to a max-heap but a node's key is less than or equal to it's children's keys

### Python: Heaps
see [[1. Notes on Python]]
#### Heaps and MaxHeap Class
- Each level of a max-heap tree grows from left to right; a new level is added only after the current level fills up completely
- Because the tree is nearly full (with at most one level not completely filled) an array implementation is efficient
- The array implementation means that the root is always at index 0 and the index of any node's parent and children can easily be calculated
	- `parent_index = (node_index - 1) // 2`
	- `left_child_index = 2 * node_index + 1`
	- `right_child_index = 2 * node_index + 2`
		- **Note** The `//` operator used in the `parent_index` calculation performs an integer division when the quotient's decimal portion, if any, is dropped
			- Also known as **Floor Division**
- The **MaxHeap** class is defined with an initially-empty list as the only data member: `self.heap_array = []`
##### The MaxHeap Class
```python
class MaxHeap:
	def __init__(self):
		self.heap_array = []
```
- The list's elements are the nodes of the tree; no actual `Node` class is used like in other tree implementations
- Even though no `Node` class is used, the elements of the list are still called nodes

#### Heap Percolate Methods
- The `MaxHeap` methods `insert()` and `remove()` make use of two methods
---
- **`percolate_up()`** takes a starting index (`node_index`) as an argument and compares the value at the `node_index(`the current value`)` to the parent value
	- If the parent value is smaller than the current value, the two items swap positions in the list and the process repeats from the current value's new position
	- The Algorithm stops when the current value reaches the root (at index 0) or when the parent value is greater than or equal to the current value, meaning no max heap violations exist
##### MaxHeap's `percolate_up()` method:
```python
def percolate_up(self, node_index):
    while node_index > 0:
        # compute the parent node's index
        parent_index = (node_index - 1) // 2
        
        # check for a violation of the max heap property
        if self.heap_array[node_index] <= self.heap_array[parent_index]:
            # no violation, so percolate up is done.
            return
        else:
            # swap heap_array[node_index] and heap_array[parent_index]
            temp = self.heap_array[node_index]
            self.heap_array[node_index] = self.heap_array[parent_index]
            self.heap_array[parent_index] = temp
            
            # continue the loop from the parent node
            node_index = parent_index
```
---
- **`percolate_down()`** method takes a starting index as an argument and compares the value at `node_index(`the current value`)` to the current value's two child values
	- If either child's value is larger than the current value, the current value swaps positions with whichever child is larger
	- The process continues from the current value's new position 
	- The Algorithm ends when the current value is at the tree's bottom level, or when both children's values are less than or equal to the current value, meaning no max heap violations exist
##### MaxHeap's `percolate_down()` method:
```python
def percolate_down(self, node_index):
    child_index = 2 * node_index + 1
    value = self.heap_array[node_index]

    while child_index < len(self.heap_array):
        # Find the max among the node and the node's children
        max_value = value
        max_index = -1
        i = 0
        while i < 2 and i + child_index < len(self.heap_array):
            if self.heap_array[i + child_index] > max_value:
                max_value = self.heap_array[i + child_index]
                max_index = i + child_index
            i = i + 1

        # check for a violation of the max heap property
        if max_value == value:
            return
        else:
            # swap heap_array[node_index] and heap_array[max_index]
            temp = self.heap_array[node_index]
            self.heap_array[node_index] = self.heap_array[max_index]
            self.heap_array[max_index] = temp
            
            # continue loop from the larger child node
            node_index = max_index
            child_index = 2 * node_index + 1
```
---
#### `insert()` and `remove()` methods
- The MaxHeap `insert()` method adds a new value to the end of the list and then uses the `percolate_up()` method to restore the max heap property
- The MaxHeap `remove()` method, has no parameters and returns the maximum value in the list (which always occurs at index 0) 
	- The list's index 0 position is assigned with the last item in the list and then the last item is removed using the list's `pop()` method
	- The max heap property is restored by calling `percolate_down()` from the index 0 position
##### MaxHeap's `insert()` and `remove()` methods
```python
def insert(self, value):
    # add the new value to the end of the array.
    self.heap_array.append(value)
    
    # percolate up from the last index to restore heap property.
    self.percolate_up(len(self.heap_array) - 1)

    
def remove(self):
    # save the max value from the root of the heap.
    max_value = self.heap_array[0]
    
    # move the last item in the array into index 0.
    replace_value = self.heap_array.pop()
    if len(self.heap_array) > 0:
        self.heap_array[0] = replace_value
        
        # percolate down to restore max heap property.
        self.percolate_down(0)
            
    # return the max value
    return max_value
```

### Treaps
##### Treap Basics
- A BST built from inserts of N nodes having randomly-ordered keys stays well-balanced and thus has near-minimum height, meaning searches, inserts, deletes are **O(logN)** 
- Because insertion order may not be controllable, a data structure that somehow randomizes BST insertions is desirable.
- A **Treap** uses a main key that maintains a binary search tree ordering property and a secondary key generated randomly (often called **priority**) during insertions that maintains a heap property
- The combination usually keeps the tree balanced 
- The word 'Treap' is a mix of tree and heap 
	- A treap **search** is the same as a BST search using the main key, since the treap is a BST.
	- A treap **insert** initially inserts a node as in a BST using the main key, then assigns a random priority to the node, and percolates the node up until the heap property is not violated. In a heap, a node is moved up via a swap with the node's parent. In a treap, a node is moved up via a _rotation at the parent_. Unlike a swap, a rotation maintains the BST property.
	- A treap **delete** can be done by setting the node's priority such that the node should be a leaf (-∞ for a max-heap), percolating the node down using rotations until the node is a leaf, and then removing the node.

##### Treap delete
- A treap delete could be done by first doing a BST delete (copying the successor to the node-to-delete, then deleting the original successor), followed by percolating the node down until the heap property is not violated. 
- However, a simpler approach just sets the node-to-delete's priority to -∞ (for a max-heap), percolates the node down until a leaf, and removes the node. 
- Percolating the node down uses rotations, not swaps, to maintain the BST property. 
- Also, the node is rotated in the direction of the lower-priority child, so that the node rotated up has a higher priority than that child, to keep the heap property.
