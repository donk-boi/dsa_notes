### Binary Trees
- In a *List* each node has up to one successor but in a **Binary Tree** each node has up to **two** children known as the **Left Child** and the **Right Child**
	- *Binary* means two which refers to the two children
- **Leaf** is a tree node with no children
- **Internal Node** is a node with at least one child
- **Parent** is a node with a child. Said to be the child's parent 
	- A node's **Ancestors** include the node's parent, the parent's parent, etc. all the way up to the tree's root
- **Root** is the one tree node with no parent (*the top node*)
##### Additional Terms to know about Binary Trees
- The link from a node to a child called an **Edge**
- A node's **Depth** is the number of edges on the path from the root to the node.
	- The root node thus has a *depth* of 0
- All nodes with the same depth form a tree's **Level**
- A tree's **Height** is the largest depth of any node.
	- A tree with just one node has a height of 0

##### Special Types of Binary Trees
- Certain Binary Tree structures can affect the speed of operations on the tree. *The following describe special types of binary trees*
	- A binary tree is *full* if every node contains 0 or 2 children
	- A binary tree is *complete* if all levels, except possibly the last level, contain all possible nodes and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.
	- A binary tree is *perfect* if all internal nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

### Applications of Trees
##### File System
- Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical data
- A tree can represent files and directories like a **File System**

##### Binary Space Partitioning
- **Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)** is a technique of repeatedly separating a region of space into 2 parts and cataloging objects contained within the regions
	- A **BSP Tree** is a binary tree used to store information for binary space partitioning
	- Each node in a BSP tree contains information about a region of space and which objects are contained in the region
- In graphics applications, a *BSP Tree* can be used to store all objects in a multidimensional world.
- The BSP Tree can then be used to efficiently determine which objects must be rendered on screen
- The viewers position in space is used to to perform a lookup within the BSP tree
- The lookup quickly eliminates a large number of objects that are not visible and therefore should not be rendered.

- Most of the tree data structures discussed serve to store a collection of values. Numerous tree types exist to store data collections in a structured way that allows for fast searching, inserting, and removing of values
### Binary Search Trees
- An especially useful form of binary tree is a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** which has an ordering property
	- That any node's **left** sub-tree keys <= the node's key
	- That any node's **right** sub-tree keys >= the node's key
- That property enables fast searching for an item
![[Pasted image 20250529200515.png]]
- **Searching** a node means to find a node with a desired key, if one exists
- A *BST* may yield faster searches than a list
- Searching a BST starts by visiting the root node
##### Example
![[Pasted image 20250529200753.png]]
- If a child to be visited does not exist, the desired node does not exist
- With this approach only a small fraction of nodes need to be compared 
![[Pasted image 20250529201021.png]]
- **BST Search Runtime Complexity** searching the BST in the worst case requires
	- **H + 1** comparisons meaning **O(H)** where **H** is the tree height
	- A major benefit is that an N-node binary tree's height may be as small as **O(logN)** yielding extremely fast searches
		- i.e. A 10,000 node list may require 10,000 comparisons but a 10,000 node BST may only require 14 comparisons
- A Binary Tree's height can be minimized by keeping all levels full, exempt possibly the last level
- Such an "all-but-last-level-full" binary tree's height is 
	- **H = (log2N)**

| Nodes N | Height H | l⁢o⁢g2⁢N | ⌊l⁢o⁢g2⁢N⌋ | Nodes per level |

- A BST defines an ordering among nodes from smallest to largest
- A BST node's **Successor** is the node that comes after in the BST ordering
	- so in ABC, As successor is B, Bs successor is C and so on
- A BST nodes's **Predecessor** is the node that comes before in the BST ordering
- If a node has a right subtree, the nodes successor is that right subtree's left-most child
