### Hash Tables
- A **Hash Table** is a data structure that stores items by mapping (or hashing) each item to a location in an array (or vector)
- i.e. Given an array with indices 0...9 to store integers from 0...500, the modulo or *remainder* operator can be used to map 25 to index 5 
	- A *Hash Table's main advantage is that searching (or inserting/removing) an item may require only **O(1)***, in contrast to **O(N) for searching a list** or to **O(log N) for binary search**
- In a hash table, an item's **Key** is the value used to map to an index.
	- For all items that might possibly be stored in the hash table, every key is ideally unique, so that the hash table's algorithms can search for a specific item by that key
	- Each hash table array element is called a **Bucket** 
		- A *Hash Function* computes the bucket index from the item's key

- **Hash Table Operations**
	- A common hash function uses the *modulo operator* **(%)** which computes the integer remainder when dividing two numbers
		- i.e. for a 20 element hash table, a hash function of `key % 20` will map keys to bucket indices 0 - 19
	- A hash table's operations of insert, remove, and search each use the hash function to determine an item's bucket
		- i.e. Inserting 113 first determines the buck to be 113 % 10 = 3

- **Collisions** 
	- A **collision** occurs when an item being inserted into a hash table maps to the same bucket as an existing item in the has table
	- **Collision Resolutions**
		- **Chaining**
			- A technique used where each bucket has a list of items
		- **Open Addressing** 
			- A technique used where collisions are resolved by looking for an empty bucket elsewhere in the table
### Chaining
- **Chaining** handles hash table collisions by using a list for each bucket, where each list may store multiple items that map to the same bucket
	- Insert operations first uses the item's key to determine the bucket and then inserts the item in that bucket's list
	- Searching also first determines the bucket and the searches the bucket's list
	- As well as for removes
