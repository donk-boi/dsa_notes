# General Notes: Types
- **Strings:**
	- A String is a sequence of characters such as a name or sentence
	- A ***String Literal*** is a string value that is specified in the source code of a program which is created by adding quotes or double quotes around a text.
	- The string type is a special construct known as a ***sequence type*** that specifies a collection of objects ordered from left to right.
		- The index of sequence type starts at 0 much like a list or an array. (i.e. zack would be 0123 z=0 a=1 c=2 k=3)
	- Built in len() function can tell you the length of a string
	- To find the specific index of a string you would use brackets
		- i.e. example = "Hello World!" and to print a specific index would look like: print(example[0], example[1], example[2] and the output would be H e l]
	- Strings can be concatenated by simply using the + symbol
		- i.e. example1 = "ABC" example2 = "123" and then: print(example1 + example2) output would be ABC123 or you could say example3 = example1 + example2 and print(example3) output would be ABC123
- **Lists:**
	- - **What**: An _ordered_, _mutable_ sequence of Python objects. Enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`.
	- **Heterogeneous**: Can contain different types in one list.
- **Tuples:**
	- - **What**: An _ordered_, _immutable_ sequence of Python objects. Enclosed in parentheses `( )` or just commas.
	- **Heterogeneous** like lists, but cannot change after creation.
- **Sets:**
	- **What**: An _unordered_ collection of _unique_ objects. Enclosed in curly braces `{…}` or via `set()` constructor.
	- **Unordered**: No indexing or slicing.
	- **Unique**: Duplicates automatically removed.	
- **Dictionaries:**
	- - **What**: A _mapping_ of keys → values. Unordered (insertion order preserved since 3.7). Enclosed in `{ key: value, … }`.
	- **Keys** must be immutable (e.g. strings, tuples). Jot Downs:

# Strings
#### Definition & Characteristics
- **What**: A sequence of Unicode characters enclosed in single (`'…'`), double (`"…"`), or triple (`'''…'''` / `"""…"""`) quotes.
- **Immutable**: Once created, the contents cannot change in place. Any “modification” returns a new string.
#### Common Operations:
##### Definition & Characteristics
- **What**: A sequence of Unicode characters enclosed in single (`'…'`), double (`"…"`), or triple (`'''…'''` / `"""…"""`) quotes.
- **Immutable**: Once created, the contents cannot change in place. Any “modification” returns a new string.
- **Concatenation**:
    `greeting = "Hello, " + "world!"`
- **Repetition**:
    `echo = "ha" * 3   # "hahaha"`
- **Indexing & Slicing**:
    `s = "Python" s[0]      # 'P' s[-1]     # 'n' s[1:4]    # 'yth' s[::-1]   # 'nohtyP'  (reverse)`
- **Length**: `len(s)`
##### Useful Method
- Case: `s.lower()`, `s.upper()`, `s.title()`
- Search: `s.find(sub)` returns index or `-1`; `s.count(sub)`
- Trim: `s.strip()`, `s.lstrip()`, `s.rstrip()`
- Replace: `s.replace(old, new)`
- Split & Join:
    `words = s.split()          # splits on whitespace url = "-".join(words)      # joins with hyphens`
#### When & Why
- Store text, user input, file paths, messages.
- Use triple-quoted strings for multi-line text (`"""docstrings"""`) or raw strings (`r"…"` for regex patterns).

# Lists
#### Definition & Characteristics
- **What**: An _ordered_, _mutable_ sequence of Python objects. Enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`.
- **Heterogeneous**: Can contain different types in one list.
#### Creation & Access
`numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] mixed  = [1, "two", 3.0, [4, 5]] first  = numbers[0] last   = numbers[-1]`
#### Mutation & Methods
- **Add / Remove**:
    `numbers.append(5) numbers.insert(2, 2.5) numbers.pop()         # removes last numbers.pop(1)        # removes at index 1 numbers.remove(3)     # removes first occurrence of value`
    
- **Sort & Reverse**:    
    `numbers.sort()        # in-place ascending numbers.sort(reverse=True) numbers.reverse()`
    
- **Comprehensions** (map/filter):
    `squares = [x*x for x in range(10)] evens   = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]`
#### When & Why
- Use when order matters and you need to add, remove, or reorder items.
- Backed by a dynamic array: O(1) access by index, amortized O(1) append, O(n) insert/pop at arbitrary positions.

# Tuples
#### Definition & Characteristics
- **What**: An _ordered_, _immutable_ sequence of Python objects. Enclosed in parentheses `( )` or just commas.
    
- **Heterogeneous** like lists, but cannot change after creation.
#### Creation & Access
`point = (3, 5) coords = 1, 2, 3 x, y = point      # unpacking`
#### Why & Use-Cases
- Use for fixed collections: coordinates, RGB colors, function returns.
- Immutable nature makes them safe as dictionary keys or set elements.
- Slightly more memory- and performance-efficient than lists.

# Sets
#### Definition & Characteristics
- **What**: An _unordered_ collection of _unique_ objects. Enclosed in curly braces `{…}` or via `set()` constructor.
- **Unordered**: No indexing or slicing.
- **Unique**: Duplicates automatically removed.
#### Creation & Operations
`a = {1, 2, 3, 2}    # becomes {1, 2, 3} b = set([2, 3, 4])`

- **Add / Remove**: `a.add(4)`, `a.remove(2)` (KeyError if missing), `a.discard(2)` (no error)
- **Membership**: `3 in a` → `True`
- **Set Algebra**:    
    `a | b   # union a & b   # intersection a - b   # difference a ^ b   # symmetric difference`
#### When & Why
- Fast membership testing (O(1)).
- Use when you need to eliminate duplicates or perform mathematical set operations.

# Dictionaries
#### Definition & Characteristics
- **What**: A _mapping_ of keys → values. Unordered (insertion order preserved since 3.7). Enclosed in `{ key: value, … }`.
- **Keys** must be immutable (e.g. strings, tuples).
#### Creation & Access
`person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30} age = person["age"]          # KeyError if missing city = person.get("city")    # returns None if missing`
#### Mutation & Methods#
- **Add / Update**: `person["email"] = "a@x.com"`
- **Remove**: `person.pop("age")`, `del person["name"]`
- **Views**:
    `person.keys()    # dict_keys([...]) person.values()  # dict_values([...]) person.items()   # dict_items([...])`
- **Comprehensions**:
    `squares = {x: x*x for x in range(5)}`
#### When & Why
- Use whenever you need to look up values by name/key instead of by position.
- Ideal for JSON-like data, counters, caches, and any time you want O(1) average key lookup.

# Type Conversions
#### Implicit vs. Explicit
- **Implicit**: Python auto-promotes types in expressions (`int + float` → `float`).
- **Explicit**: You call conversion functions yourself: 
    `int("42")      # 42 float("3.14")  # 3.14 str(100)       # "100" list((1,2,3))  # [1, 2, 3] dict([("a",1)]) set("abracadabra") tuple([1,2,3])`
#### Pitfalls
- Converting invalid strings raises `ValueError`.
- `int(3.9)` truncates toward zero, doesn’t round.
- Converting from container to container copies contents; be mindful of performance on large structures.

# Binary Numbers
#### Why Binary?
- Under the hood, integers are stored in base-2. Understanding binary helps with bitwise operations, masks, and low-level data tasks.
#### Literals & Conversion
- **Literal**: prefix `0b` or `0B`:    
    `x = 0b1011    # 11 in decimal`
    **Convert**:    
    `bin(13)       # '0b1101' int('1101', 2)  # 13`

##### Bitwise Operators:

| Operator | Meaning                  | Example        |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| `&`      | AND                      | `5 & 3` → `1`  |
| \|       | OR                       | `5 \| 3` → `7` |
| `^`      | XOR                      | `5 ^ 3` → `6`  |
| `~`      | NOT (bitwise complement) | `~5` → `-6`    |
| `<<`     | Left shift               | `1 << 3` → `8` |
| `>>`     | Right shift              | `8 >> 2` → `2` |

# String Formatting

#### `%`-Formatting (old style)
`name = "Bob" age  = 25 "Hello, %s. You are %d." % (name, age)`
#### `str.format()` (py3+)
`"Hello, {}. You are {}.".format(name, age) "Coordinates: {lat:.2f}, {lon:.2f}".format(lat=37.24, lon=-115.81)`
#### f-Strings (3.6+)
- **Most modern** and concise:
    `f"Hello, {name}. You are {age}." f"{value:.3f}"       # format specifiers work here too f"{x=}, {y=}"        # yields "x=10, y=20"`
- Can even embed expressions:
    `f"{age * 2 = }"      # "age * 2 = 50"`
#### Alignment, Padding & Width
`f"|{name:<10}|{age:^5}|{score:>8.2f}|"`
- `<` left-align, `^` center, `>` right-align
- Width and precision controlled after `:`.
