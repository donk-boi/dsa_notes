# General Notes: Classes
- **Class:** A blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes (data) and methods (behavior).  
- **Instance:** An object created from a class; holds its own state.  
- **Constructor (`__init__`):** Special method that initializes new instances.  
- **Methods:** Functions defined inside a class that operate on instances (`self`).  
- **Class vs. Instance Attributes:** Class attributes are shared; instance attributes are per-object.  
- **Encapsulation:** Bundle data and methods; use naming conventions (`_private`) to indicate non-public members.  
- **Operator Overloading:** Define special methods (dunder methods) like `__add__`, `__str__` to customize behavior.  
- **Interface:** The public methods and properties a class exposes. 

# Classes: Introduction
### Definition  
A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates related data and functions into a single entity.
### Notes
- Think of **[[Objects]]** as a grouping of data(variables) much like how we have metal, plastic, wood, etc. and these are low-level items, things that are made from these materials such as tables, chairs, tvs, etc. are higher-level items. 
	- Objects are the same in programming.  Objects(higher-level items) are made from variables, functions, etc. (lower-level items)
- **Abstraction / Information Hiding** 
	- *Abstraction* occurs when a user interacts with an object at a high level, allowing internal details to remain hidden *also known as* **Information Hiding or Encapsulation**.
		- i.e. An oven supports an abstraction of food compartment and a knob to control heat. An oven's user does not need to interact with the internal parts of the oven.
	- An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a data type whose creation and update are constrained to specific well-defined operations. A class can be used to implements an ADT.
- **Python Built-In Objects** are objects that are automatically created in python which include basic data types such as:
	- Integers and Strings
### Usage / When to Use  
- Model real-world objects or structured data in your programs.  
- Organize code into logical, reusable components.
### Details / Tips  
- Define a class when you need multiple related functions operating on shared data.
#### Example:  
```python
class Person:
    pass

p = Person()
```
#### Example2:
```python
# Built in objects
string1 = "Hello World!"
integer1 = 1999
# These are examples of Python's built in objects because they conatin functions that make up the object that are all built into the language.
```
# Classes: Grouping Data
### Definition
Classes group related attributes (fields) together, rather than using separate variables or tuples.
### Notes
The **Class** keyword can be used to create a user-defined type of object containing groups of related variables and functions.
- i.e. minutes and seconds (since they are closely related to one another)
```python
class ClassName:
    # Statement-1
    # Statement-2
    # ...
    # Statement-N
```
- A Class defines a new type that can group data and functions to form an object.
- The object maintains a set of **Attributes** that determine the data and the behavior of the class.
```python
class Time:
    """ A class that represents a time of day """
    def __init__(self):
        self.hours = 0
        self.minutes = 0
```
- Above: The code defines a new class containing two attributes (*hours and minutes*) whose values are initially 0
**Instantiation** is an operation that is performed by "calling" the class using parentheses like a function call as in `my_time = Time()`. 
- An instantiation operation creates an **Instance**, which is an individual object of the given class.
- An instantiation operation automatically calls the `__init__` method
	- A **Method** is a function defined within class
	- The **`__init__`** method (commonly known as a **Constructor**) is a responsible for setting up the initial state of the new instance.
	- The `__init__` method has a single parameter, *'self'*, that automatically references the instance being created.
		- A programmer would write an expression such as `self.hours = 0` within the `__init__` method to create a new attribute, `hours`.
- **Using Instantiation to create a variable using the Time class**
```python
class Time:
    """ A class that represents a time of day """
    def __init__(self):
        self.hours = 0
        self.minutes = 0

my_time = Time()
my_time.hours = 7
my_time.minutes = 15

print(f'{my_time.hours} hours', end=' ')
print(f'and {my_time.minutes} minutes')
```
**Attribute Reference Operator***
- Attributes can be accessed using the attribute reference operator (`.`)
- Sometimes called the *Member Operator* or *Dot Notation*
- This allows a programmer to access attributes that are initialized in the class so they can call on it later on.
*Attribute Reference Operator*
```python
class Time:
	def __init__(self):
		self.hours = 0
		self.minutes = 0

time1 = Time()
time1.hours = 7
time2.minutes = 15
```
- This also allows a programmer to create multiple instances of a class
*Attribute Reference Operator 2: Multiple Instances of a Class*
```python
class Time:
    """ A class that represents a time of day """
    def __init__(self):
        self.hours = 0
        self.minutes = 0

time1 = Time()  # Create an instance of the Time class called time1
time1.hours = 7
time1.minutes = 30

time2 = Time()  # Create a second instance called time2
time2.hours = 12
time2.minutes = 45

print(f'{time1.hours} hours and {time1.minutes} minutes')
print(f'{time2.hours} hours and {time2.minutes} minutes')
```
### Usage / When to Use
- When you have multiple pieces of data that logically belong together (e.g., a point’s x and y coordinates).
### Details / Tips
- Use instance attributes to store per-object data.
- Prefer descriptive attribute names for readability.
#### Example:
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

pt = Point(3, 5)
print(pt.x, pt.y)  # 3 5
```
# Instance Methods
### Definition
Functions defined within a class that operate on instance data; receive `self` as their first parameter.
### Notes
**Instance Methods** refer to a function defined within a class. An *instance method* can be referenced using dot notation.
```python
class Time:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hours = 0
        self.minutes = 0

    def print_time(self):        print(f'Hours: {self.hours}', end=' ')
        print(f'Minutes: {self.minutes}')

time1 = Time()
time1.hours = 7
time1.minutes = 15
time1.print_time()

# Which would display: "Hours: 7 Minutes: 15"
```
- The definition of print_time() has a parameter "self" that provides a reference to the class instance. 
- In the program above, `'self'` is bound to `time1` when `time1.print_time()` is called.
- A programmer does not specify an argument for `'self'` when calling the function.
	- The argument list in `time1.print_time()` is empty.
- The method's code can use `'self'` to access other attributes or methods of the instance.
	- The `print_time` method uses `'self.hours'` and `'self.minutes'` to get the value of the `time1` instance data attributes.
 `__init__` revisited
 - `__init__` is a **Special Method Name** indicating that the method implements some special behavior of the class.
	 - In this case that special behavior is the initialization of new instances and special methods can always be identified by the *double underscores* that appear before and after the identifier.
		 - *Good Practice is to avoid using the double underscores in identifiers to prevent collisions with special method names, which the Python interpreter recognized and may handle differently.*
- A common error for new programmers is to omit the self argument as the first parameter of a method.
	- In such cases, calling the method produces an error indicating too many arguments were given by the programmer, because a method call automatically inserts an instance reference as the first argument.
##### Accidentally forgetting the self parameter of a method generates an error when calling the method
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self):
        self.wage = 0
        self.hours_worked = 0

    def calculate_pay():  # Programmer forgot self parameter        return self.wage * self.hours_worked

alice = Employee()
alice.wage = 9.25
alice.hours_worked = 35
print(f'Alice earned {alice.calculate_pay():.2f}')

# Results in the following error:
```
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 13, in <module>
TypeError: calculate_pay() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
```

### Usage / When to Use
- Encapsulate behavior that uses or modifies an object’s attributes.
### Details / Tips
- Always include `self` in the signature.
- Can return values or modify the instance in place.
#### Example:
```python
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def increment(self):
        self.count += 1

    def value(self):
        return self.count

c = Counter()
c.increment()
print(c.value())  # 1
```
# Class and Instance Objects Types
### Definition
- **Class Object:** The class itself is an object of type `type`.
- **Instance Object:** Objects created from the class.
### Notes
A **Class Object** acts as a factory that creates instance objects.
An **Instance Object** is initialized via the `__init__` method.
- *Below is an example of this:*

![[Pasted image 20250516123942.png]]
- A **Class Attribute** is shared among all instances of that class. Class attributes are defined within the scope of a class.
```python
class MarathonRunner:
    race_distance = 42.195  # Marathon distance in kilometers
    def __init__(self):
        # ...

    def get_speed(self):
        # ...

runner1 = MarathonRunner()
runner2 = MarathonRunner()

print(MarathonRunner.race_distance)  # Look in class namespace
print(runner1.race_distance)  # Look in instance namespace
print(runner2.race_distance)

# Output would be: 
	42.195
	42.195
	42.195
```
- An **Instance Attribute** can be unique to each instance.
```python
class MarathonRunner:
    race_distance = 42.195  # Marathon distance in kilometers

    def __init__(self):
        self.speed = 0        # ...

    def get_speed(self):
        # ...

runner1 = MarathonRunner()
runner1.speed = 7.5
runner2 = MarathonRunner()
runner2.speed = 8.0
print(f'Runner 1 speed: {runner1.speed}')
print(f'Runner 2 speed: {runner2.speed}')

# Output would be:
	Runner 1 speed: 7.5
	Runner 2 speed: 8.0
```
- Instance attributes are created using dot notation as in `self.speed = 7.5` within a method or `runner1.speed = 7.5` from outside of the class's scope.
- Instance and class namespaces are linked to each other.
	- If a name is not found in an instance namespace, then the class namespace is searched.
- Besides methods, typical class attributes are variables required only by instances of the class. 
	- Placing such constants in the class scope helps to reduce possible collisions with other variables or functions in the global scope.
##### How changing the gmt_offset class attribute affects behavior of all instances.
```python
class Time:
    gmt_offset = 0  # Class attribute. Changing alters print_time output
    
    def __init__(self):  # Methods are a class attribute too
        self.hours = 0  # Instance attribute
        self.minutes = 0  # Instance attribute

    def print_time(self):  # Methods are a class attribute too
        offset_hours = self.hours + self.gmt_offset  # Local variable
        
        print(f'Time -- {offset_hours}:{self.minutes}')

time1 = Time()
time1.hours = 10
time1.minutes = 15

time2 = Time()
time2.hours = 12
time2.minutes = 45

print ('Greenwich Mean Time (GMT):')
time1.print_time()
time2.print_time()

Time.gmt_offset = -8  # Change to PST time (-8 GMT)

print('\nPacific Standard Time (PST):')
time1.print_time()
time2.print_time()

# Would output:
	Greenwich Mean Time (GMT):
	Time -- 10:15
	Time -- 12:45
	
	Pacific Standard Time (PST):
	Time -- 2:15
	Time -- 4:45
```
- Even though class and instance attributes have unique namespaces, a programmer can use the `'self'` parameter to reference either type.
	- `self.hours` finds the **instance attribute**, `hours`.
	- `self.gmt_offset` finds the **class attribute**, `gmt_offset`.
	- **Good practice is to avoid name collisions between class and instance attributes.**
### Usage / When to Use
- Use class objects to attach class-level data or methods (via `@classmethod`).
### Details / Tips
- Check types with `isinstance(obj, Class)` and `type(obj)`.
#### Example:
```python
class MyClass:
    pass

obj = MyClass()
print(type(MyClass))       # <class 'type'>
print(isinstance(obj, MyClass))  # True
```
# Class Constructors
### Definition
The `__init__` method run automatically when a new instance is created.
### Notes
- A class instance is initialized to a specific state.
	- The `__init__` method constructor can be customized with additional parameters, as shown below:
##### Adding parameters to a constructor
```python
class RaceTime:
    def __init__(self, start_time, end_time, distance):
        """
         start_time: Race start time. String w/ format 'hours:minutes'.
         end_time: Race end time. String w/ format 'hours:minutes'.
         distance: Distance of race in miles.
        """
    # ...

# The race times of marathon contestants
time_jason = RaceTime('3:15', '7:45', 26.21875)
time_bobby = RaceTime('3:15', '6:30', 26.21875)
```
- The above constructor has 3 additional parameters:
	- `start_time`
	- `end_time`
	- `distance`
- When instantiating a new instance of `RaceTime`, arguments must be passed to the constructor.
	- i.e. `RaceTime('3:15', '7:45', 26.21875)`
- The example below fully implements the `RaceTime` class, adding methods to print the time taken to complete the race and average pace.
##### Additional parameters can be added to a class constructor
```python
class RaceTime:

    def __init__(self, start_hrs, start_mins, end_hrs, end_mins, dist):
        self.start_hrs = start_hrs
        self.start_mins = start_mins
        self.end_hrs = end_hrs
        self.end_mins = end_mins
        self.distance = dist

    def print_time(self):
        if self.end_mins >= self.start_mins:
            minutes = self.end_mins - self.start_mins
            hours = self.end_hrs - self.start_hrs
        else:
            minutes = 60 - self.start_mins + self.end_mins
            hours = self.end_hrs - self.start_hrs - 1

        print(f'Time to complete race: {hours}:{minutes}')

    def print_pace(self):
        if self.end_mins >= self.start_mins:
            minutes = self.end_mins - self.start_mins
            hours = self.end_hrs - self.start_hrs
        else:
            minutes = 60 - self.start_mins + self.end_mins
            hours = self.end_hrs - self.start_hrs - 1

        total_minutes = hours*60 + minutes
        print(f'Avg pace (mins/mile): {total_minutes / self.distance:.2f}')

distance = 5.0

start_hrs = int(input('Enter starting time hours: '))
start_mins = int(input('Enter starting time minutes: '))
end_hrs = int(input('Enter ending time hours: '))
end_mins = int(input('Enter ending time minutes: '))

race_time = RaceTime(start_hrs, start_mins, end_hrs, end_mins, distance)

race_time.print_time()
race_time.print_pace()
```
- And the output would be:
```
Enter starting time hours: 5
Enter starting time minutes: 30
Enter ending time hours: 7
Enter ending time minutes: 00
Time to complete race: 1:30
Avg pace (mins/mile): 18.00

...

Enter starting time hours: 5
Enter starting time minutes: 30
Enter ending time hours: 6
Enter ending time minutes: 24
Time to complete race: 0:54
Avg pace (mins/mile): 10.80
```
- Constructor parameters can have default values like any other function using the `name = value` syntax.
	- Default parameter values may indicate the default state of an instance.
	- A programmer might then use constructor arguments only to modify the default state if necessary.
		- i.e. The Employee class constructor in the program below uses default values that represent a typical new employee's wage and scheduled hours per week.
##### Constructor default parameters
```python
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, wage=8.25, hours=20):
        """
        Default employee is part time (20 hours/week)
        and earns minimum wage
        """
        self.name = name
        self.wage = wage
        self.hours = hours

    # ...

todd = Employee('Todd')  # Typical part-time employee
jason = Employee('Jason')  # Typical part-time employee
tricia = Employee('Tricia', wage=12.50, hours=40)  # Manager employee

employees = [todd, jason, tricia]

for e in employees:
    print (f'{e.name} earns {e.wage*e.hours:.2f} per week')
```
And the output would be:
```
Todd earns 165.00 per week
Jason earns 165.00 per week
Tricia earns 500.00 per week
```
Similar to calling functions , default parameter values can be mixed with positional and name-mapped arguments in an instantiation operation
- Arguments without default values are required , must come first, and must be in order.
- The following arguments with default values are optional and can appear in any order.
##### Consider the class definition below. Match the instantiations of Student to the matching list of attributes.(Answers)
```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, grade=9, honors=False, athletics=False):
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade
        self.honors = honors
        self.athletics = athletics

    # ...
```
```
Student('Tommy) = self.name: 'Tommy', self.grade: 9, self.honors: False, self.athletics: False

Student('Tommy', grade=9, honors=True, athletics=True) = self.name: 'Tommy', self.grade: 9, self.honors: True, self.athletics: True

Student('Johnny', grade=11, athletics=False) = self.name: 'Johnny', self.grade:11, self.honors: False, self.athletics: False

Student('Johnny', grade=11, honors=True) = self.name: 'Johnny', self.grade: 11, self.honors: True, self.athletics: False
```
### Usage / When to Use
- Initialize instance attributes with provided arguments or default values.    
### Details / Tips
- Do not return from `__init__`; always return `None`.    
- Use default parameters to make some arguments optional.
#### Example:
```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, width, height=1):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

r1 = Rectangle(4, 2)
r2 = Rectangle(3)
```
# Class Interfaces
### Definition
The set of public methods and properties through which users interact with a class.
### Notes
A Class usually contains a set of methods that a programmer interacts with.
- i.e. the class `RaceTime` might contain the instance methods `print_time()` and `print_race()` that a programmer calls to print output.
- A **Class Interface** consists of methods that a programmer calls to create, modify, or access as class instance.
- The figure below shows the *Class Interface* of the `RaceTime` class which consists of the `__init__` constructor and then `print_time()` and `print_race()` methods.
```python
class RaceTime:
    def __init__(self, start_time, end_time, distance):
        # ...

    def print_time(self):
        # ...

    def print_pace(self):
        # ...
```
A class may also contain methods used internally that a user of the class need not access.
- For example, if the `RaceTime` class contains a separate method `_diff_time()` used by `print_time()` and `print_pace()` to find the total number of minutes to complete a race. A programmer using the `RaceTime` class does not need to use the `_diff_time()` function directly; thus `_diff_time()` does not need to be a part of the class interface.
	- *Good practice is to  prepend an underscore to methods only used internally by a class*
	- The underscore is a widely recognized convention but otherwise has no special syntactic meaning
- A programmer could still call the method
	- i.e. `time1._diff_time()` though such usage should be unnecessary if the class interface is well-designed.
##### `RaceTime` Class with internal instance method usage and definition highlighted
```python
class RaceTime:
    def __init__(self, start_hrs, start_mins, end_hrs, end_mins, dist):
        self.start_hrs = start_hrs
        self.start_mins = start_mins
        self.end_hrs = end_hrs
        self.end_mins = end_mins
        self.distance = dist

    def print_time(self):
        total_time = self._diff_time()        print(f'Time to complete race: {total_time[0]}:{total_time[1]}')

    def print_pace(self):
        total_time = self._diff_time()        total_minutes = total_time[0]*60 + total_time[1]
        print(f'Avg pace (mins/mile): {total_minutes / self.distance:.2f}')

    def _diff_time(self):        """Calculate total race time. Returns a 2-tuple (hours, minutes)"""
        if self.end_mins >= self.start_mins:
            minutes = self.end_mins - self.start_mins
            hours = self.end_hrs - self.start_hrs
        else:
            minutes = 60 - self.start_mins + self.end_mins
            hours = self.end_hrs - self.start_hrs - 1

        return (hours, minutes)

distance = 5.0

start_hrs = int(input('Enter starting time hours: '))
start_mins = int(input('Enter starting time minutes: '))
end_hrs = int(input('Enter ending time hours: '))
end_mins = int(input('Enter ending time minutes: '))

race_time = RaceTime(start_hrs, start_mins, end_hrs, end_mins, distance)

race_time.print_time()
race_time.print_pace()
```
- And the output would be:
```
Enter starting time hours: 5
Enter starting time minutes: 30
Enter ending time hours: 7
Enter ending time minutes: 0
Time to complete race: 1:30
Average pace (mins/mile): 18.00
...
Enter starting time hours: 9
Enter starting time minutes: 30
Enter ending time hours: 10
Enter ending time minutes: 3
Time to complete race: 0:33
Avg pace (mins/mile): 6.60
```
- A class can be used to implement the computing concept known as an **[[Abstract Data Type (ADT)]]**, who's creation and update are constrained to specific well-defined operations (*the class interface*)
	- A key aspect if an ADT is that the internal implementation of the data and operations are hidden from the user, a concept known as *information hiding*, which allows the ADT user to be more productive by focusing on higher-level concepts.
		- It also allows the ADT dev to improve the internal implementation without requiring changes to programs using the ADT.
- Programmers commonly refer to separating an object's *interface* from its *implementation* (internal methods and variables); 
	- The user of an object needs to know only the object's interface
- **Python lacks the ability to truly hide information from a user of the ADT, because all attributes of a class are always accessible from the outside.**
	- Many other computing languages require methods and variables to be marked as either *public* (part of a class interface) or *private* (internal), and attempting to access private methods and variables results in an error.
- Python on the otherhand is more of a "trusting" language.
	- An ADT user can always inspect, and if desired, use private variables and methods in ways unexpected by the ADT dev
### Usage / When to Use
- Design interfaces that are intuitive and hide internal implementation details.
### Details / Tips
- Prefix “private” members with a single underscore (`_`).
- Use docstrings to document intended usage.
#### Example:
```python
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance=0):
        self._balance = balance  # internal

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self._balance += amount

    def get_balance(self):
        return self._balance
```
# Class Customization
### Definition
Overriding special methods to change built-in behavior (e.g., string representation, comparison).
### Notes
**Class Customization** is the process of defining how an instance of a class should behave from some common operations.
- Such operations should include
	- *Printing*
	- *Accessing Attributes*
	- *Or how instances of that class are compared to each other*
- To customize a class, a programmer implements instance methods with **Special method names** that the Python interpreter recognizes
	- i.e. change how a class instance object is printed
		- the special `__str__()` method can be defined, as illustrated below
##### Normal Printing
```python
class Toy:
    def __init__(self, name, price, min_age):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.min_age = min_age

truck = Toy('Monster Truck XX', 14.99, 5)
print(truck)
```
- which outputs:
```
<__main__.Toy instance at 0xb74cb98c>
```
##### Customized Printing
```python
class Toy:
    def __init__(self, name, price, min_age):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.min_age = min_age

    def __str__(self):
        return (f'{self.name} costs only ${self.price:.2f}. Not for children under {self.min_age}!')

truck = Toy('Monster Truck XX', 14.99, 5)
print(truck)
```
- which outputs:
```
Monster Truck XX costs only $14.99. Not for children under 5!
```
*The first program* prints a default string for the class instance
*While the second program* implements the `__str__()` generating a custom message using some instance attributes.

**Class Customization** can redefine the functionality of built-in operators (<, >, =, +, - , etc) when used with class instances. This is a technique known as **Operator Overloading**
##### Overloading the less  than operator of the `Time` class allows for comparison of instances
```python
class Time:
    def __init__(self, hours, minutes):
        self.hours = hours
        self.minutes = minutes

    def __str__(self):
        return f'{self.hours}:{self.minutes}'

    def __lt__(self, other):
        if self.hours < other.hours:
            return True
        elif self.hours == other.hours:
            if self.minutes < other.minutes:
                return True
        return False

num_times = 3
times = []

# Obtain times from user input
for i in range(num_times):
    user_input = input('Enter time (Hrs:Mins): ')
    tokens = user_input.split(':')
    times.append(Time(int(tokens[0]), int(tokens[1])))

min_time = times[0]
for t in times:
    if t < min_time :
        min_time = t

print(f'\nEarliest time is {min_time}')
```
- which outputs
```
Enter time (Hrs:Mins): 10:40
Enter time (Hrs:Mins): 12:15
Enter time (Hrs:Mins): 9:15

Earliest time is 9:15
```
- In this program, the `Time` class contains a definition for the `__lt__` method which overloads the `<` operator.
- When the comparison `t < min_time` is evaluated, the `__lt__` method is automatically called.
- the `self` parameter of `__lt__` is bound to the left operand `t` and the other parameter is bound to the right operand `min_time` 
- Returning `True` indicates that `t` is indeed less than `min_time` and returning `False` indicates that `t` is equal to or greater than `min_time`
	- Methods like `__lt__` are known as **Rich Comparison Methods** 
	- The following table describes rich comparison methods and the corresponding relational operator that is overloaded

| Rich Comparison Method | Overloaded Operator             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `__lt__(self, other)`  | less than (`<`)                 |
| `__le__(self, other)`  | less than or equal to (`<=`)    |
| `__gt__(self, other)`  | greater than (`>`)              |
| `__ge__(self, other)`  | greater than or equal to (`>=`) |
| `__eq__(self, other)`  | equal to (`==`)                 |
| `__ne__(self, other)`  | not equal to (`!=`)             |
### Usage / When to Use
- Make objects behave naturally with built-in functions (`str()`, `len()`, comparisons).
### Details / Tips
- Common dunder methods: `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, `__lt__`, `__len__`.
#### Example:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Person({self.name})"

p = Person("Alice")
print(p)  # Person(Alice)
```
# More Operator Overloading: Classes as Numeric Types
### Definition
Implement numeric dunder methods (`__add__`, `__sub__`, `__mul__`, etc.) so instances behave like numbers.
### Notes
```python
def __sub__(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, int): # right op is integer
        return Time24(self.hours - other, self.minutes)

    if isinstance(other, Time24):  # right op is Time24
        if self > other:
            larger = self
            smaller = other
        else:
            larger = other
            smaller = self

        hrs = larger.hours - smaller.hours
        mins = larger.minutes - smaller.minutes
        if mins < 0:
            mins += 60
            hrs -=1

        # Check if times wrap to new day
        if hrs > 12:
            hrs = 24 - (hrs + 1)
            mins = 60 - mins

        # Return new Time24 instance
        return Time24(hrs, mins)

    print(f'{type(other)} unsupported')
    raise NotImplementedError
```

| Method                      | Description                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `__add__(self, other)`      | Add `(+)`                             |
| `__sub__(self, other)`      | Subtract `(-)`                        |
| `__mul__(self, other)`      | Multiply `(*)`                        |
| `__truediv__(self, other)`  | Divide `(/)`                          |
| `__floordiv__(self, other)` | Floored Division `(//)`               |
| `__mod__(self, other)`      | Modulus `(%)`                         |
| `__pow__(self, other)`      | Exponentiation `(**)`                 |
| `__and__(self, other)`      | 'and' logical operator                |
| `__or__(self, other)`       | 'or' logical operator                 |
| `__abs__(self)`             | Absolute Value `(abs())`              |
| `__int__(self)`             | Convert to integer `(int())`          |
| `__float__(self)`           | Convert to floating point `(float())` |
### Usage / When to Use
- Create classes that represent quantities or vectors and support arithmetic.
### Details / Tips
- Ensure operations return new instances rather than modifying in place (immutable style).
#### Example:
```python
class Vector:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x, self.y = x, y

    def __add__(self, other):
        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Vector({self.x}, {self.y})"

v1 = Vector(1,2)
v2 = Vector(3,4)
print(v1 + v2)  # Vector(4, 6)
```
