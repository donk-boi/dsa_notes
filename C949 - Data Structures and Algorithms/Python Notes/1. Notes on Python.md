# General Notes

### Definitions
A **program** consists of instructions that execute one at a time. Inside a program are:
- **Input** - Receiving data (file, keyboard, touchscreen, network, etc.)
- **Process** - Performing computations on the input data
- **Output** - Puttisdang that data somewhere (file, screen, network, etc.)

Programs use **[[3. variables]]** to refer to data such as x, y, z
Think of a **program** like a *recipe*

**Computational Thinking** is the act of creating a sequence of instructions to solve a problem and in turn, a sequence of instructions which solves a problem is called an **algorithm**

A **Python Interpreter** is a computer program that executes code written in the Python programming language. And an Interactive interpreter is a program that allows the user to execute one line of code at a time.

### Jot Downs
- Code is a common word for the textual representation of a program, a Line is a row of text

- The interactive interpreter displays a prompt that indicates that the interpreter is ready to accept code. 

- You write code in a python file and the interpreter reads the file starting at the top and ends when the last line of the file has been read.

- **Types of syntax** in python include:
	- ***Statements:*** The program's instructions (a program mostly consists of a series of statements)
	- ***Expressions:*** Code that return a value when evaluated such as a mathematical equation or formula (Python can read various types of math symbols such as  + , - , * , / , etc.)
	- ***Variables:*** Created when assigning something using the = symbol (such as user = zack, 'user' being the variable) Variables hold value 
	- ***The print function:*** Displays text (print("Hello World!") would display Hello World! and print(user) would display Zack)
	- ***Comments:*** Using # before a line would create a comment that only the person viewing the file could see. Meaning that it does not display in the code and does not need to follow certain syntax rules, they are just to help explain something to a human reader
	- Assignment Statement: Assigns a variable with a value until something is assigned to that variable again.

### Print Functions Syntax

### Jot Downs
- Text enclosed in quotes are referred to as a **String**.
- Any space, tab or newline is called **Whitespace**
- Escape sequences are strings that have special meanings:
	- *Newline Character:* \n creates a newline
	- *Tab Character:* \t inserts a tab
	- *Backslash Character:* two backslashes prints a backslash

### Input Statements Syntax 
- ***The input()*** function is used to read input from a user, you assign a variable with an input() and whatever the user types will be assigned to that variable.
	- This causes the program to wait until the user has entered text and pushed the return key

### Converting input types
- There is a difference between '123' and 123
	- The quotes make this input a string while no quotes could indicate that the input is an integer or int value
- ***[[2. Type]]:*** A type determines how a value can behave such as with math (the int 2 can be divided by 2 (2 / 2) but a string "2" cannot be divided)
- Reading from an input will always result in a string type unless converted (which can be done)
	- user_age = int(input())

### Random Jot Downs
- Incrementing is common and it is when you increase a variables value by 1 such as (x = x +1)
- Python has built in functions such as print() input() type() id()
	- print() is to print or display text
	- input() gets input from a user
	- type() identifies the object's type (string, int, float, etc.)
	- id() is for an objects numeric identifier which is stored in the computers memory
- Immutable vs. Mutable:
	- Mutability refers to whether or not an object's value is allowed to be changed
		- Mutable = it is
		- Immutable = it is not
# Sections:

## [[4. Branches (If-Else)]]
#### Syntax
`if condition:     # code elif other_condition:     # code else:     # code`
#### Truthiness
- Falsy: `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `[]`, `{}`, `None`, `False`
- Truthy: everything else
#### Best practices
- Keep conditions simple; extract complex logic to named booleans or helper functions.
- Use chained comparisons: `0 < x < 10`    
- Avoid deep nesting—use guard clauses:
    `if not valid:     return # main logic`****

## [[5. Loops]]
#### `for` loops
- Iterate sequences:    
    `for item in [1, 2, 3]:     print(item)`
- Use `enumerate()` for index/item:
    `for i, v in enumerate(my_list):     ...`

#### `while` loops
- Loop until condition false:
    `while x < 5:     x += 1`
#### Control flow
- `break` exits loop
- `continue` skips to next iteration
- `else` on loops executes if no `break`:
    `for x in seq:     if x == target:         break else:     print("Not found")`
## [[6. Functions]]
#### Definition & invocation
`def my_func(a, b=2, *args, **kwargs):     """Docstring describing purpose."""     return a + b`
- Positional, default, varargs (`*args`), keyword args (`**kwargs`).
#### Annotations & typing
`def greet(name: str) -> str:     return f"Hello, {name}"`
#### Scope & closures
- Local variables inside functions
- Use `nonlocal` to modify enclosing scope

## [[7. Lists and Dictionaries]]
#### Lists
- Creation: `lst = [1, 2, 3]`; comprehension: `[x*2 for x in range(5)]`
- Common ops:
    - Append: `lst.append(x)`
    - Insert: `lst.insert(i, x)`
    - Remove: `lst.remove(x)`, `lst.pop(i)`
    - Slice: `lst[1:4]`, `lst[::-1]`
#### Dictionaries
- Creation: `d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}`; from pairs: `dict([('x', 9), ('y', 10)])`
- Access & ops:
    - Get: `d['a']`, safe: `d.get('c', default)`
    - Add/update: `d['c'] = 3`
    - Remove: `d.pop('b')`, `del d['b']`
    - Keys/values/items: `d.keys()`, `d.values()`, `d.items()`
- Comprehension: `{k: v*2 for k, v in old_dict.items() if v > 0}`

## [[8. Classes]]
#### Definition
`class MyClass(BaseClass):     """Docstring for class."""     class_var = 0      def __init__(self, x):         self.x = x  # instance variable      def method(self, y):         return self.x + y    @classmethod     def cls_method(cls):         return cls.class_var    @staticmethod     def static_method(z):         return z * 2`

#### Key concepts
- **Encapsulation:** prefix with `_` to signal “private”
- **Inheritance & polymorphism:** override methods in subclasses 
- **Dunder methods:** `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__eq__`, `__len__`, etc.

## [[9. Recursion]] 
#### Concept
- Function calls itself with a simpler/smaller argument
- **Base case** required to avoid infinite recursion
**Example: factorial**
`def factorial(n: int) -> int:     if n <= 1:         return 1     return n * factorial(n - 1)`
**Example: Fibonacci**
`def fib(n: int) -> int:     if n in (0, 1):         return n     return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)`

#### Best practices
- Always define and test the base case
- Beware of Python’s recursion limit (default ~1000); consider iterative or memoized approaches for deep recursion
- Use `functools.lru_cache` to cache results on pure recursive functions
