# General Notes: Loops
- **Loops (general):** Repeating a block of code either over a collection or until a condition changes.  
- **While Loops:** Repeat while a boolean condition remains true (unknown iteration count).  
- **More While Loop Examples:** Common patterns like sentinel-controlled input, accumulators, and retries.  
- **Counting:** Accumulate totals or tallies across iterations.  
- **For Loops:** Iterate directly over items in an iterable (known collection).  
- **Counting Using `range()`:** Generate numeric sequences for index-based or count-controlled loops.  
- **While vs. For Loops:** Compare condition-driven vs. collection-driven repetition.  
- **Nested Loops:** Place loops inside loops to handle multi-dimensional data or Cartesian products.  
- **Developing Programs Incrementally:** Build and test loops step-by-step to simplify debugging.  
- **Break and Continue:** `break` exits a loop early; `continue` skips to the next iteration.  
- **Loop `else`:** An `else` block that runs only if the loop wasn’t terminated by `break`.  
- **`enumerate()`:** Retrieve both index and value when iterating over an iterable.

# Loops (general)  
- **Definition:** A control structure that repeats a block of code while a condition holds or over a collection.  
- **Types in Python:**  
  - **Definite (for):** `for item in iterable:`  
  - **Indefinite (while):** `while condition:`  
# While Loops
### Definition
- Repeats its block *as long as* a Boolean condition is `True`.  
### Use case 
- When the number of iterations isn’t known in advance. 
#### Example:
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
# More While Loop Examples
#### Sentinel Loop (user input):
```python
cmd = ""
while cmd.lower() != "quit":
    cmd = input("Command (or 'quit'): ")
    print("You entered:", cmd)
```
#### Accumulator Loop:
```python
total = 0
num = None
while num != 0:
    num = int(input("Enter number (0 to end): "))
    total += num
print("Sum:", total)
```
#### Retry with Break
```python
attempts = 3
while attempts > 0:
    pwd = input("Password: ")
    if pwd == "secret":
        print("Access granted")
        break
    attempts -= 1
else:
    print("Access denied")
```
# Counting
### Definition: 
- Tally or sum values across loop iterations.
#### Example (sum 1 to n):
```python
n = 10
total = 0
for i in range(1, n+1):
    total += i
print("Sum:", total)  # 55
```
# For Loops
### Definition
- Iterates directly over elements of an iterable.
### Use Case
- When processing every item in a known collection.
#### Example:
```python
for color in ["red","green","blue"]:
    print(color.upper())
```
# Counting Using the Range() Function
### Forms:
- `range(stop)`
- `range(start, stop)`
- `range(start, stop, step)`
#### Example:
```python
for i in range(1, 11):    # 1–10
    print(i)
```
# While vs. For Loops
| Feature         | `while`                           | `for`                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Control         | Condition-driven                  | Iterates over iterable             |
| Iteration count | Unknown/pre-compute               | Known at start                     |
| Infinite risk   | Higher if condition never changes | Lower—ends when iterable exhausted |
# Nested Loops
### Definition
- A loop inside another loop.
### Use Case
- Multi-dimensional data (e.g., matrix).
#### Example:
```python
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
for row in matrix:
    for val in row:
        print(val, end=" ")
    print()
```
# Developing Programs Incrementally
### Definition
- Build loops in small, testable parts.
### Steps
1. Sketch loop structure with placeholder prints.
2. Test basic flow.
3. Replace placeholders with actual logic.
# Break and Continue
### Break:
- Exit a loop immediately
#### Example:
```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)  # 0–4
```
### Continue:
- Skip to next iteration
#### Example:
```python
for i in range(6):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)  # 1,3,5
```
# Loop `else`
### Definition
- `else` block runs only if loop completes without `break`.
#### Example:
```python
for num in [1,3,5]:
    if num == target:
        print("Found")
        break
else:
    print("Not found")
```
# Getting Both Index and Value: `enumerate()`
### Definition
- Yields `(index, element)` pairs from an iterable.
#### Example:
```python
for i, fruit in enumerate(["apple","banana"], start=1):
    print(f"{i}. {fruit}")
# 1. apple
# 2. banana
```

# Summary:
Loops in Python provide a way to automate the repetitive execution of a block of code, either for a known collection of items or until a certain condition changes. **Definite loops**, implemented with `for`, iterate over every element in an iterable—like a list, tuple, or string—allowing you to process each item in turn without manually managing an index. **Indefinite loops**, implemented with `while`, continue as long as a Boolean condition remains true, making them ideal for scenarios such as reading user input until a sentinel value is entered or accumulating values until a specific threshold is reached. Both types of loops support control-flow modifiers: `break` to exit early when a certain criterion is met, and `continue` to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next.

Choosing between `for` and `while` often comes down to whether you know up front how many iterations you need. If you have a collection or a numeric range—e.g. processing each element in a list or iterating `range(n)`—a `for` loop is concise, clear, and less error-prone. When the number of steps depends on data or external events, a `while` loop provides the flexibility to repeat until a condition changes. Using `enumerate()` with `for` loops lets you access both each item and its index, avoiding manual counters. Nested loops let you handle multi-dimensional or hierarchical data structures (like matrices or JSON objects), but they should be used judiciously since complexity grows multiplicatively.

Writing reliable, maintainable loops also means developing incrementally and testing small pieces before adding more logic. Starting with simple placeholders or print statements helps verify that your loop structure and termination conditions behave as expected. Adding a loop’s optional `else` clause can provide a clean way to handle “not found” or “no break” scenarios after completing all iterations. By understanding when to use `for` versus `while`, how to manage loop flow with `break`/`continue`, and how to leverage tools like `range()` and `enumerate()`, you’ll have a robust toolkit for handling repetitive tasks efficiently and clearly in your Python programs.
