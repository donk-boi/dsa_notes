# General Notes: [[Recursion]]
- **Recursion:** A function calling itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem.  
- **Base Case:** A simple condition where the function returns a result without further recursion—prevents infinite loops.  
- **Recursive Case:** The branch where the function reduces its problem and calls itself.  
- **Call Stack:** Each recursive call adds a new frame; deep recursion can hit Python’s recursion limit (~1000).  
- **Use Cases:** Tree/graph traversals, divide-and-conquer algorithms (e.g., quicksort), combinatorial generation.  
- **Debugging:** Inserting print statements or using a debugger helps trace recursion depth and values.  
- **Performance:** Beware exponential time in naive recursion; use memorization or iterative solutions when appropriate.

# Recursive Functions
### Definition  
Functions that invoke themselves to solve subproblems of the original task.
### Notes
*A function may call other functions, including itself.*
A function that calls itself is known as a **Recursive Function**
### Usage / When to Use  
- When a problem naturally splits into similar subproblems (e.g., directory tree walk).
### Details / Tips  
- Always include a base case before the recursive call.  
- Ensure each recursive step moves toward the base case.
#### Example:  
```python
def countdown(n):
    if n <= 0:
        print("Blastoff!")
    else:
        print(n)
        countdown(n - 1)
```
# Recursive Algorithm: Search
### Definition
A search that explores data structures (like trees or lists) by recursively branching into sub-structures.
### Notes
An **[[Algorithm(s)]] is a sequence of steps for solving a problem**
- i.e. an algorithm for making lemonade is:
	- Make Lemonade
		- Add sugar to pitcher
		- Add lemon juice
		- Add water
		- Stir
- *Each step is distinct* 
- Alternatively, an *algorithm* for mowing the lawn is:
	- Mow the lawn
		- Mow the frontyard
			- Mow the left front
			- Mow the right front
		- Mow the backyard
			- Mow the left back
			- Mow the right back
- This moving algorithm is defined **Recursively** because the mowing algorithm's steps themselves consist of mowing but of a smaller region.
##### Another Example of a Recursive Algorithm:
![[Pasted image 20250520223829.png]]
*A recursive function* is a natural match for the **[[Recursive Binary Search Algorithm]]**
- We can define a function `find(low,high)` whose parameters indicate the low and high sides of the guessing range.
- The function guesses at the midpoint of the range
- If the user says lower, the function calls `find(low,mid)` if the user says higher the function calls `find(mid+1,high)`
#### The following program illustrates this:
##### A recursive function find() carrying out a binary search algorithm
```python
def find(low, high):
    mid = (high + low) // 2  # Midpoint of low..high
    answer  = input(f'Is it {mid}? (l/h/y): ')

    if (answer != 'l') and (answer != 'h'):  # Base case
        print('Got it!')
    else:
        if answer == 'l':
            find(low, mid)
        else:
            find(mid+1, high)

print('Choose a number from 0 to 100.')
print('Answer with:')
print('   l (your num is lower)')
print('   h (your num is higher)')
print(' any other key (guess is right).')

find(0, 100)
```
- The output would be:
```
Choose a number from 0 to 100.
Answer with:
   l (your num is lower)
   h (your num is higher)
 any other key (guess is right).
Is it 50? (l/h/y): l
Is it 25? (l/h/y): h
Is it 38? (l/h/y): h
Is it 44? (l/h/y): l
Is it 41? (l/h/y): y
Got it!
```
- The recursive function has an `if-else` statement, where the if branch is the end of the recursion, known as the **Base Case**.
- The else branch has the recursive calls.
	- Such an `if-else` pattern is quite common in recursive functions.
Consider the following program, in which a recursive algorithm is used to find an item in a sorted list.
- This example is for demonstration purposes only, a programmer would be better off using the `list.index()` or `in` operator to find a specific list element.
- *BUT* consider having a list of attendees at a conference, whose names have been sorted in alphabetical order in a list.
	- The Following program determines whether a particular person is in attendance.
#### Recursively searching a sorted list
```python
def find(lst, item, low, high):
    """
    Finds index of string in list of strings, else -1.
    Searches only the index range low to high
    Note: Upper/Lower case characters matter
    """
    range_size = (high - low) + 1
    mid = (high + low) // 2

    if item == lst[mid]:  # Base case 1: Found at mid
        pos = mid
    elif range_size == 1:  # Base case 2: Not found
        pos = -1
    else:  # Recursive search: Search lower or upper half
        if item < lst[mid]:  # Search lower half
            pos = find(lst, item, low, mid)
        else:  # Search upper half
            pos = find(lst, item, mid+1, high)

    return pos

attendees = []

attendees.append('Adams, Mary')
attendees.append('Carver, Michael')
attendees.append('Domer, Hugo')
attendees.append('Fredericks, Carlo')
attendees.append('Li, Jie')

name = input("Enter person's name: Last, First: ")
pos = find(attendees, name, 0, len(attendees)-1)

if pos >= 0:
    print(f'Found at position {pos}.')
else:
    print('Not found.')
```
- Which would output:
```
Enter person's name: Last, First: Simpson, Homer
Not found.
...
Enter person's name: Last, First: Domer, Hugo
Found at position 2.
```
The `find()` function restricts its search to elements within the range `low` to `high`.
- The script passes a range encompassing the entire list, namely `0` to `(list length -1)`
- `find()` compares to the middle element returning that element's position if matching and if not, then `find()` checks if the window's size is just one element, returning `-1`
	- In that case to indicate the item was not found because there is nothing left to search in the window.
- If neither of those two base cases are satisfied, then `find()` uses recursive binary search, recursively searching either the lower or the upper half of the range as appropriate.
##### Example of the steps (visualized) of the above code:
![[Pasted image 20250520225342.png]]
In general, any recursive solution can also be done using loops.
- However, in some cases, using a recursive algorithm may make a solution more *clear, concise, and understandable* 
- Candidates for recursion are problems that can be reduces to smaller and identical problems and then solved.
Above, the binary search algorithms iteratively reduced the problem by half, eventually reached a base case where the problem could be solved. (the desired element was located)
### Usage / When to Use
- Searching in nested lists or tree-like data (e.g., file system, organizational chart).
### Details / Tips
- Combine recursion with conditional checks for the target.
- Use short-circuit returns to stop early when found.
#### Example:
```python
def recursive_search(lst, target):
    if not lst:
        return False
    head, *tail = lst
    if head == target:
        return True
    if isinstance(head, list) and recursive_search(head, target):
        return True
    return recursive_search(tail, target)
```
# Adding Output Statements for Debugging
### Definition
Inserting `print()` calls inside a recursive function to trace its execution and parameter values.
### Notes
```python
def find(lst, item, low, high, indent):
    """
    Finds index of string in list of strings, else -1.
    Searches only the index range low to high
    Note: Upper/Lower case characters matter
    """
    print(f'{indent} find() range {low} {high}')
    range_size = (high - low) + 1
    mid = (high + low) // 2

    if item == lst[mid]:  # Base case 1: Found at mid
        print(f'{indent} Found person.')
        pos = mid
    elif range_size == 1:  # Base case 2: Not found
        print(f'{indent} Person not found.')
        pos = -1
    else:  # Recursive search: Search lower or upper half
        if item < lst[mid]:  # Search lower half
            print(f'{indent} Searching lower half.')
            pos = find(lst, item, low, mid, indent + '   ')
        else:  # Search upper half
            print(f'{indent} Searching upper half.')
            pos = find(lst, item, mid+1, high, indent + '   ')

    print(f'{indent} Returning pos = {pos}.')
    return pos

attendees = []

attendees.append('Adams, Mary')
attendees.append('Carver, Michael')
attendees.append('Domer, Hugo')
attendees.append('Fredericks, Carlo')
attendees.append('Li, Jie')

name = input("Enter person's name: Last, First: ")
pos = find(attendees, name, 0, len(attendees)-1, '   ')

if pos >= 0:
    print(f'Found at position {pos}.')
else:
    print( 'Not found.')
```
- Which would output:
```
Enter person's name: Last, First: Meeks, Stan
    find() range 0 4
    Searching upper half.
       find() range 3 4
       Searching upper half.
          find() range 4 4
          Person not found.
          Returning pos = -1.
       Returning pos = -1.
    Returning pos = -1.
Not found.
...
Enter person's name: Last, First: Adams, Mary
    find() range 0 4
    Searching lower half.
       find() range 0 2
       Searching lower half.
          find() range 0 1
          Found person.
          Returning pos = 0.
       Returning pos = 0.
    Returning pos = 0.
Found at position 0.
```
### Usage / When to Use
- Diagnose incorrect base-case logic or unexpected parameter values.
### Details / Tips
- Prefix prints with indentation proportional to recursion depth for clarity.
- Remove or comment out debug prints when done.
#### Example:
```python
def fib(n, depth=0):
    print("  " * depth + f"fib({n}) called")
    if n < 2:
        result = n
    else:
        result = fib(n - 1, depth + 1) + fib(n - 2, depth + 1)
    print("  " * depth + f"fib({n}) returning {result}")
    return result
```
# Creating a Recursive Function
### Definition
The process of designing a function that solves a problem by calling itself.
### Notes
Creating a recursive function can be accomplished in two steps:
- Write a *Base Case* 
	- Every recursive function must have a case that returns a value without performing a recursive call. That case is called the **Base Case** and a programmer may write that as part of the function first and then the test (there can be multiple)
- Write a *Recursive Case* 
	- The programmer then adds the recursive case to the function
##### Writing a recursive function for factorial: First writing base case and then adding recursive case
![[Pasted image 20250521211346.png]]
### Usage / When to Use
- When an iterative approach is complex or less intuitive.
### Details / Tips
1. **Identify** the simplest possible input and its output (base case).
2. **Determine** how to reduce any input toward the base case (recursive case).
3. **Combine** results of recursive calls to form the final answer.
#### Example:
```python
def sum_list(lst):
    if not lst:            # base case
        return 0
    return lst[0] + sum_list(lst[1:])  # recursive case
```
# Recursive Math Functions
### Definition
Mathematical algorithms implemented recursively, often matching their mathematical definitions.
### Notes
Recursive functions can be used to solve certain math problems such as computing the Fibonacci sequence.
- The Fibonacci sequence is a pattern that uses the sum of the two previous numbers to compute the next number
#### Fibonacci Sequence step-by-step
```python
"""
Output the Fibonacci sequence step-by-step.
Fibonacci sequence starts as:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ... in which the first
two numbers are 0 and 1 and each additional
number is the sum of the previous two numbers
"""
def fibonacci(v1, v2, run_cnt):
    print(f'{v1} + {v2} = {v1+v2}')

    if run_cnt <= 1:  # Base case:
                      # Ran for user's number of steps
        pass  # Do nothing
    else:             # Recursive case
        fibonacci(v2, v1+v2, run_cnt-1)

print ('This program outputs the\n'
       'Fibonacci sequence step-by-step,\n'
       'starting after the first 0 and 1.\n')

run_for = int(input('How many steps would you like?'))

fibonacci(0, 1, run_for)
```
- Which would output:
```
This program outputs the
Fibonacci sequence step-by-step,
starting after the first 0 and 1.

How many steps would you like?10
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
3 + 5 = 8
5 + 8 = 13
8 + 13 = 21
13 + 21 = 34
21 + 34 = 55
34 + 55 = 89
```

### Usage / When to Use
- Functions like factorial, Fibonacci, power, greatest common divisor.
### Details / Tips
- Recognize when memorization (`functools.lru_cache`) can optimize repeated calls.
#### Example:
```python
# Factorial
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Fibonacci with caching
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(None)
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```
# Recursive Exploration of All Possibilities
### Definition
Brute-force generation of all combinations or permutations via recursion.
### Notes

### Usage / When to Use
- Generating subsets, permutations, solving puzzles (e.g., Sudoku, N-Queens).
### Details / Tips
- Often involves branching on choices and backtracking by undoing changes when returning.
#### Example:
```python
def permutations(seq):
    if len(seq) <= 1:
        return [seq]
    perms = []
    for i, elem in enumerate(seq):
        for rest in permutations(seq[:i] + seq[i+1:]):
            perms.append([elem] + rest)
    return perms

print(permutations([1, 2, 3]))
```
# Summary
Recursion is a powerful technique where functions call themselves to break down complex problems into simpler subproblems. You always need a **base case** to terminate recursion, and a **recursive case** that moves toward that base. Recursive searches traverse nested structures elegantly, while recursive math functions often mirror their mathematical definitions. Debugging recursion is facilitated by strategic `print()` statements showing call depth. When generating all possibilities—such as permutations or combinations—recursion with backtracking handles branching and state reversal cleanly. Despite its elegance, recursion carries performance and stack-depth considerations, so always evaluate whether memorization or iterative solutions might be more efficient for your use case.
