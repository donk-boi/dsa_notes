# General Notes: Branches
- **if-else branches**  
  Execute different code paths based on a Boolean condition.
- **Detecting equal values with branches**  
  Use `==` and `!=` to compare for equality or inequality.
- **Detecting ranges with branches**  
  Test whether a value falls within a numeric range using comparison operators.
- **Detecting ranges with logical operators**  
  Combine comparisons with `and`, `or`, `not` to form compound conditions.
- **Detecting ranges with gaps**  
  Check multiple disjoint ranges in one expression or with multiple tests.
- **Detecting multiple features with branches**  
  Use nested or chained `if/elif/else` to test for more than two possibilities.
- **Comparing data types and common errors**  
  Beware of mixing types in comparisons and watch out for assignment (`=`) vs. equality (`==`).
- **Membership and identity operators**  
  - `in`, `not in` to test membership in sequences or mappings  
  - `is`, `is not` to test object identity
- **Order of evaluation**  
  Python evaluates expressions left to right, respecting operator precedence.
- **Code blocks and indentation**  
  Indentation defines block structure; consistent use is required.
- **Conditional expressions**  
  The ternary-style `A if condition else B` expression for concise branches.

# If-Else Branches
### Definition  
- **`if` statement**: Tests a condition; if true, runs its block.  
- **`else` clause**: Runs when the `if` condition is false.
#### Syntax & Example:
```python
if score >= 60:
    print("Passed")
else:
    print("Failed")
```
# Detecting Equal Values with Branches
### Operators
- `==` tests equality
- `!=` tests inequality
#### Example:
```python
if response == "yes":
    proceed()
elif response != "no":
    print("Please answer yes or no.")
```
# Detecting Ranges with Branches
### Using Comparison Chaining
```python
if 0 <= temperature <= 100:
    print("Within safe range")
```
### Single Comparisons
```python
if temperature >= 0 and temperature <= 100:
    print("Within safe range")
```
# Detecting Ranges with Logical Operators
### Logical Connectives
- `and`: both sub-conditions true
- `or`: at least one true
- `not`: inverts a Boolean
#### Example:
```python
if (x > 0 and x < 10) or x == 20:
    handle_special(x)
```
# Detecting Ranges with Gaps
### Disjoint Ranges
- Use multiple comparisons or `or` clauses.
#### Example:
```python
if 0 <= score < 50 or 80 < score <= 100:
    print("Out of middle range")
```
# Detecting Multiple Features with Branches
### Chained `elif`
#### Example:
```python
if grade >= 90:
    letter = 'A'
elif grade >= 80:
    letter = 'B'
elif grade >= 70:
    letter = 'C'
else:
    letter = 'F'
```
# Comparing Data Types and Common Errors
### Type Mismatch
- Comparing different types (e.g. `5 == "5"`) always false.
- Avoid accidental assignment (`=`) inside conditionsâ€”Python disallows it, but watch for `==`.
#### Example:
```python
if value == None:      # discouraged
    ...
if value is None:      # preferred
    ...
```
# Membership and Identity Operators
### Membership
- `in`, `not in` for sequences, sets, dicts:
```python
if item is my_list:
    ...
```
### Identity
- `is`, `is not` to test whether two names refer to the same object:
```python
if a is b:
    ...
```
# Order of Evaluation
### Precedence
1. Parentheses
2. Comparison (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`)
3. Logical `not`
4. Logical `and`
5. Logical `or`
#### Example:
```python
# Equivalent to: if ((a and (b or not c)) is True) ...
if a and b or not c:
    ...
```
# Code Blocks and Indentation
### Rules
- All statements in the same block must have the same indentation.
- Typically 4 spaces per level (PEP 8)
#### Example:
```python
if condition:
    do_step1()
    do_step2()
# This line is outside the if-block
```
# Conditional Expressions
### Ternary Syntax
```python
result = "even" if n % 2 == 0 else "odd"
```
### Use Cases
- Quick assignments based on a condition in a single line.
