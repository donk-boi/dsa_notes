### The Array: The Foundational Data Structure
- ***Data*** is the broad term that refers to all types of information down to the most basic numbers and strings
- A **data structure** refers to how data is organized (as well as receiving manipulation and returning)
- An **Array** is a list of data elements
- An **Index** of an *array* is the number that identifies where a piece of data lives inside the array.
- Most data structures are used in four basic ways which are referred to as ***Operations*** those operations are:
	- ***Reading***: Which is looking something up from a particular spot within the data structure. With an *array* this would mean looking up a value at a particular index 
	- ***Searching***: Which refers to looking for a particular value within a data structure. With an *array* this would mean looking to see if a particular value exists within the array and if so which index is it at.
	- ***Inserting***: Which refers to adding another value to our data structure. With an *array* this would mean adding a new value to an addition slot within the array
	- ***Deleting***: Which refers to removing a value from our data structure. With an *array* this would mean removing one of the values from the array
