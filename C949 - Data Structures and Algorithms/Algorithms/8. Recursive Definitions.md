# Refer to [[Algorithm(s)]] for general notes
### Recursive Algorithms
- A **Recursive Algorithm** is an algorithm that breaks the problem into smaller sub-problems and applied that algorithm itself to solve the smaller sub-problems.
- Because the problem cannot be endlessly divided into smaller sub-problems, a recursive algorithm must have a **Base Case**.
	- A case where a recursive algorithm completes without applying itself to a smaller problem

### Recursive Functions
- A **Recursive Function** is a function that calls itself.
- Recursive Functions are commonly used to implement recursive algorithms
