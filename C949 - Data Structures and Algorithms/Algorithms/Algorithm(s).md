# General Notes on algorithms
**An Algorithm** describes a sequence of steps to solve a computational problem or perform a calculation.
- An algorithm can be described in English, pseudocode, a programming language, hardware, etc.
- A **Computational Problem** specifies an input, a question about the input that can be answered using a computer, and finally, the desired output.

*Efficient Algorithms and Hard Problems*
Computer Scientists and programmers typically focus on using and designing efficient algorithms to solve problems.
- Efficiency is most commonly measured by the algorithm run time and an to be labeled as efficient it should take no longer than polynomial time with respect to the input size
**NP-Complete Problems** are a set of problems for which no known efficient algorithm exists and have the following characteristics:
- No efficient algorithms
- No one has proven that one exists or if its impossible
- If one exists, then all NP-Complete problems can be solved efficiently
*By knowing a problem is NP-complete, instead of trying to find an efficient algorithm to solve the problem, a programmer can focus on finding an algorithm to efficiently find a good, but non-optimal, solution.*
