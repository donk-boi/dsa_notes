### Upper and Lower Bounds
- **An Algorithm** with runtime complexity `T(N)` has a lower bound and an upper bound
	- **Lower Bound** - A function f(N) that is <= the best case T(N), for all values of N >= 1
	- **Upper Bound** - A function f(N) that is >= the worst case T(N), for all values of N >= 1
- Given a function T(N), an infinite number of lower bounds and upper bounds exist
	- i.e. If an algorithm's best case runtime is `T(N) = 5N + 4`, then subtracting any non-negative number integer yields a lower bound: `5N + 3, 5N + 2, etc` So if two additional criteria are commonly used to choose a preferred upper or lower bound, the preferred bound:
		1. Is a single-term polynomial
		2. Bounds the T(N) as tightly as possible

### Growth Rates and Asymptotic Notations
- An additional simplification can factor out the constant from a bounding function, leaving a function that categorizes the algorithm's growth rate.
	- i.e. Instead of saying that an algorithm's runtime function has an upper bound of 30N^2, the algorithm could be described as having a worst case growth rate of N^2 
- An **Asymptotic Notation** is the classification of runtime complexity that uses functions that indicate only the growth rate of a bounding function.
- Three *Asymptotic Notations* are commonly used in complexity analysis:
	- **O Notation** - Provides a growth rate for an algorithm's upper bound
	- **Ω notation** - Provides a growth rate for an algorithm's lower bound
	- **Θ notation** - Provides a growth rate that is both upper and lower bound
