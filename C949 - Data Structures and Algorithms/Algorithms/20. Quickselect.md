### Quickselect 
- **Quickselect** is an algorithm that selects the k-th smallest element in a list
	- i.e. Running *quick select* on a list (15, 73, 5, 88, 9) with `k = 0` returns the smallest element in the list (5)
- For a list with **N** elements, *Quickselect* uses [[16. Quicksort]]'s partition function to partition the list into low partition containing the **X** smallest elements and a high partition containing **N-X** largest elements
- The **K-th** smallest element in the low partition if `k <=` the last index in the low partition and in the high partition otherwise
- Quickselect is recursively called on the partition that contains the **K-th** element 
- When a partition of size 1 is encountered, quickselect has found the **K-th** smallest element
- Quickselect partially sorts the list when selecting the **K-th** smallest element
### Quickselect Algorithm's Runtime Complexity
- The best case and average runtime complexity of *Quickselect* are both **O(N)**
- The worst case it could be **O(N^2)**
