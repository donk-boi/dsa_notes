### Bucket Sort
- **Bucket Sort** is a numerical sorting algorithm that distributes numbers into buckets, sorts each bucket with an additional sorting algorithm, and then concatenates buckets together to build the sorted result.
	- A **Bucket** is a container for numerical values in a specific range
	- Bucket sort is designed for arrays with non-negative numbers
- Bucket sort first creates a list of buckets, each representing a range of numerical values
- Collectively, buckets represent the range from 0 to maximum value in the array
- For **N** buckets and maximum values of **M** each bucket represents **(M + 1) / N**
	- i.e. for 10 buckets and a maximum value of 49, each bucket represents *(49 + 1) / 5 values* 
		- The first bucket will hold values ranging from 0 - 4
		- The second bucket will hold values ranging from 5 -9
		- etc
	- Each array element is placed in the appropriate bucket
	- The Bucket index is calculated as **(number * N / (M + 1))** 
	- Then each bucket is sorted with an addition sorting algorithm
	- Lastly, all buckets are concatenated together in order and copied to the original array.
