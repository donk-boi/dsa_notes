### Big O Notation
- **Big O Notation** is a mathematical way of describing how a function behaves in relation to the input size
	- *Specifically, to a runtime of an algorithm*
- *Big O Notation* all functions have the same growth rate (as determined by the highest order term) are characterized using the same *Big O Notation* 
	- All functions that have the same growth rate are considered equivalent in Big O Notation
- *Given a function that describes the runtime of an algorithm, the **Big O Notation** for that function can be determined using the following rules*
	1. If f(x) is a sum of several terms, the highest order term (*the one with the fastest growth rate*) is kept and all others are discarded
	2. If f(x) has a term that is a product of several factors, all constants (*those that are not in terms of x*) are omitted.

### Runtime Growth Rate
- One consideration in evaluating algorithms is that the efficiency of the algorithm is most critical for large input sizes
- Small inputs are likely to result in fast runtimes because N is small, so efficiency is less of a concern

- *Note that the data assumes that a single instruction takes 1 nanosecond to execute*

- *Note that 2^n and n! are omitted because it would disable the ability to see the other functions which indicates how much their runtimes would actually take in a practical application*
### Common Big O Complexities
- Algorithms have runtime functions that belong to one of a handful of growth functions, these common Big O Notations are summarized in the following table
- The table shows the Big O Notation , the common word used to describe algorithms that belong to that notation, and an example of source code.
- **Clearly the best algorithm is one that has constant time complexity**
	- But unfortunately, not all problems can be solved using constant complexity algorithms.
- In many cases, computer scientists have proven that certain types of problems can only be solved using quadratic or exponential algorithms.
