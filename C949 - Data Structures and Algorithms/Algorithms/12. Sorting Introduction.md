### Sorting Intro
- **Sorting** is the process of converting a list of elements into a ascending or descending order.
- The challenge of sorting is that a program cant "see" the entere list to know where to move an element
	- Instead, a program is limited to simpler steps typically **Observing** or **Swapping** just two elements at a time
		- Sorting just by swapping values is an important part of sorting algorithms
- A python programmer could make use of the `sort()` list method or `sorted()` built-in function
