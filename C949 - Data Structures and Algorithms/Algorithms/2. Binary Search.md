### Using Binary Search
- Linear search may require search all list elements, which can lead to long runtimes.
	- i.e. Searching for a contact on a smartphone one by one from first to last can be time consuming.
- Using a **Binary Search** could be more useful because it it checks the middle contact first if the desired contact comes alphabetically before the middle contact, binary search will then search the first half, otherwise the last half
- Each step reduces the contacts that need to be searched by half.
### Binary Search Algorithm
- **Binary Search** is a faster algorithm for searching a list if the list's elements are sorted and directly accessible.
- Binary Search first checks the middle element of the list
- If the search key is found, the algorithm returns the matching location.
- If the search key is not found, the algorithm repeats the search on the remaining left sublist or the remaining right sublist
##### Binary Search Algorithm in Python
```python
def binary_search(numbers, key):
    low = 0
    high = len(numbers) - 1

    while high >= low:
        mid = (high + low) // 2
        if numbers[mid] < key:
            low = mid + 1
        elif numbers[mid] > key:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1 # not found
   
 
numbers = [2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 32, 45, 87]
print('NUMBERS:', end=' ')
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=' ')
print()
 
key = int(input('Enter a value: '))
key_index = binary_search(numbers, key)

if key_index == -1:
    print(f'{key} was not found.')
else:
    print(f'Found {key} at index {key_index}.')
```
- the output would be:
```
NUMBERS: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 87 
Enter a value: 10
Found 10 at index 3.
...
NUMBERS: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 87 
Enter a value: 17
17 was not found.
```
### Binary Search Efficiency
- Binary search is incredibly efficient in finding an element within a sorted list.
- During each iteration, the search space is reduced by half
- The search terminates when the element is found or the search space is empty
	- i.e. for 32 elements, if the search key is not found the search space is halved to 16, then 8, 4, 2, 1 and then finally none only requiring **6 steps**.
- For an **N element list** the max number of steps required to reduce the search space to an empty subsist is:
