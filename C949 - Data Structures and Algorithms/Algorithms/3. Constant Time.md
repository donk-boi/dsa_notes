# Refer to [[Algorithm(s)]] for general notes
### Constant Time Operations
- In practice, designing an efficient algorithm aims to lower the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to run.
- A single algorithm can always execute more quickly on a faster processor.
- Therefore, theoretical analysis of an algorithm describes runtime in terms if number of constant time operations, not nanoseconds.
- **A Constant Time Operation** is an operation that, for a given processor, always operates in the same amount of time, regardless of input values.
### Identifying Constant Time Operations
- The programming language being used, as well as the hardware running the code, both affect what is and what is not a constant time operation.
	- i.e. Most modern processors perform arithmetic operations on integers and floating point values at a fixed rate that is unaffected by operand values.
		- Part of the reason for this is that the floating point and integer values have  a fixed size.
