### Worst-Case Algorithm Analysis
- To analyze how runtime of an algorithm scales as the input size increases, we first determine how many operations the algorithm executes for a specific input size N
- Then the Big O notation for that function is determined
- Algorithm runtime analysis often focuses on the worst-case runtime complexity.
- **Worst-Case Runtime** of an algorithm is the runtime complexity for an input that results in the longest execution
	- Other analysis include the *best-case and average-case runtime complexity*
- Determining the **Average-Case** runtime complexity requires knowledge of the statistical properties of the expected data inputs
### Counting Constant Time Operations
- For algorithm analysis, the definition of a single operation does not need to be precise 
- An operation can be any statement that has a constant runtime complexity
- Since constants are omitted in *Big-O Notation*, any constant number of constant time operations is O(1).
	- Counting the number of constant time operations in a finite sequence is not needed.
### Runtime Analysis of Nested Loops
- Runtime analysis for nested loops requires summing the runtime of the inner loop over each outer loop iteration.
- The resulting summation can be simplified to determine the *Big-O Notation*
