# Refer to [[Algorithm(s)]] for general notes
### Algorithm Efficiency
- An algorithm describes the method to solve a computational problem.
- Programmers and computer scientists should use or write efficient algorithms
- **Algorithm Efficiency** is typically measured by the algorithm's computational complexity
	- **Computational Complexity** is the amount of resources used by the algorithm.
- Most Common resources considered are the *runtime* and *memory usage*
### Runtime Complexity, Best Case, and Worst Case
- An algorithm's **Runtime Complexity** is a function, T(N), that represents the number of the constant time operations performed by the algorithm of an input size of N
- Because an algorithm's runtime may vary significantly based on the input data, a common approach is to identify best and worst case scenarios.
	- An algorithm's **Best Case** is the scenario where the algorithm does the minimum possible number of operations.
	- An algorithm's **Worst Case** is the scenario where the algorithm does the maximum possible number of operations.

### Space Complexity
- An algorithm's **Space Complexity** is a function, S(N), that represents the number of fixed-size memory units used by the algorithm for an input size of N
- *Space Complexity* includes the input data and additional memory allocated by the algorithm
- An algorithm's **Auxiliary Space Complexity** is the space complexity not including the input data
