### Buckets
- **Radix Sort** is a sorting algorithm specifically designed for integers
- The algorithm makes use of a concept called **buckets** and is a type of [[21. Bucket Sort]]
- An array of integer values can be sub-divided by using the integer values' digits
	- **A Bucket** is a collection of integer values that all share a particular digit value

### Radix Sort Algorithm
- **Radix Sort Algorithm** is a sorting algorithm specifically for an array if *integers* 
- The Algorithm processes one digit at a time starting with least significant digit and ending with the most significant
- **Two Steps are needed for each digit**
	- First: All array elements are placed into buckets based on the current digit's value
	- Second: The array is rebuilt by removing all elements in order from lowest bucket to highest

### Sorting Signed Integers
- If the array contains **Negative** numbers, the above examples would sort by absolute value meaning that the integers would not be correctly sorted
- A *small* extension to the algorithm correctly handles negative integers
- The algorithm would use a bucket for negative numbers and then sort them in reverse order so that they are sorted correctly

### Radix Sort with Different Bases
- This section presents radis sort with base 10 but other bases can be used as well
	- i.e. Using base 2 is another common approach where only 2 buckets would be required instead of 10
### Radix Sort in Python
- The radix sort algorithm sorts a list of integers by grouping elements based on the element's digits, starting with the least significant digit and ending with the most significant. 
- Two steps are needed for each digit. 
	- First, all list elements are placed into buckets based on the current digit's value. 
	- Then, the list is rebuilt by removing all elements from buckets, in order from lowest bucket to highest.
- The `radix_sort()` function below has one parameter, numbers, which is an unsorted list of integers. A list is a mutable object, so changes to numbers inside the function will all affect any variable that references that list.
- A list of 10 lists is used for the buckets. The `radix_get_max_length()` function determines the number of relevant powers of 10. 
- The digit-index loop then iterates through those powers of 10. 
	- The first inner loop places the elements into buckets based on the current power of 10. 
	- The second inner loop moves elements out of buckets and back into the numbers list, in order from lowest bucket index to highest. 
	- After the digit-index loop, two new lists are built, one containing all negative elements from the numbers list and the other containing all non-negative elements. 
	- Then, the reversed negative list is concatenated with the non-negative list into the numbers list to produce the sorted result.
##### Python Code Example:
```python
# Returns the maximum length, in number of digits, out of all list elements 
def radix_get_max_length(numbers):
    max_digits = 0
    for num in numbers:
        digit_count = radix_get_length(num)
        if digit_count > max_digits:
            max_digits = digit_count
    return max_digits

# Returns the length, in number of digits, of value
def radix_get_length(value):
    if value == 0:
        return 1
   
    digits = 0
    while value != 0:
        digits += 1
        value = int(value / 10)
    return digits

def radix_sort(numbers):
    buckets = []
    for i in range(10):
        buckets.append([])
    
    # Find the max length, in number of digits
    max_digits = radix_get_max_length(numbers)
    
    pow_10 = 1
    for digit_index in range(max_digits):
        for num in numbers:
            bucket_index = (abs(num) // pow_10) % 10
            buckets[bucket_index].append(num)

        numbers.clear()
        for bucket in buckets:
            numbers.extend(bucket)
            bucket.clear()
      
        pow_10 = pow_10 * 10
    
    negatives = []
    non_negatives = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num < 0:
            negatives.append(num)
        else:
            non_negatives.append(num)
    negatives.reverse()
    numbers.clear()
    numbers.extend(negatives + non_negatives)

# Create a list of unsorted values
numbers = [47, 81, 13, 5, 38, 96, 51, 64]

# Print unsorted list
print('UNSORTED:', numbers)

# Call radix_sort to sort the list
radix_sort(numbers)

# Print sorted list
print('SORTED:', numbers)
```
- output:
```
UNSORTED: [47, 81, 13, 5, 38, 96, 51, 64] 
SORTED: [5, 13, 38, 47, 51, 64, 81, 96]
```
