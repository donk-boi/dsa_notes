### Insertion Sort Algorithm
- **Insertion Sort** is a sorting algorithm that treats the input as two parts,
	- *Sorted*
	- *Unsorted*
- And then repeatedly inserts the next value from the unsorted part into the correct location in the sorted part
##### Insertion Sort Algorithm 
```python
def insertion_sort(numbers):
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        j = i
        # Insert numbers[i] into sorted part 
        # stopping once numbers[i] in correct position
        while j > 0 and numbers[j] < numbers[j - 1]:
            # Swap numbers[j] and numbers[j - 1]
            temp = numbers[j]
            numbers[j] = numbers[j - 1]
            numbers[j - 1] = temp
            j = j - 1

numbers = [10, 2, 78, 4, 45, 32, 7, 11]
print('UNSORTED:', end=' ')
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=' ')
print()
 
insertion_sort(numbers)
print('SORTED:', end=' ')
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=' ')
print()
```
- Output:
```
UNSORTED: 10 2 78 4 45 32 7 11 
SORTED: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 78
```
###### Some Steps / Walkthrough

### Insertion Sort Execution
- The variable `i` denotes the starting position of the current element in the unsorted part
- Initially, the first element (i.e. **element at index 0**) is assumed to be sorted, so the outer (for) loop initializes `i` to `1` 
- The inner (while) loop inserts the current element into the sorted part bt repeatedly swapping the current element with the elements in the sorted part that are larger
- Once a smaller or equal element is found in the sorted part, the current element has been inserted into the correct location and while loop terminates
### Insertion Sort Runtime
- Insertion sort's typical runtime is **O(N)^2**
- If a list has N elements, the outer loop executes **N - 1** times
- For each outer loop execution, the inner loop may need to examine all elements in the sorted part
	- Thus the inner loop executes on average **N / 2** times
- So the total number of comparisons is proportional to 
	- **(N - 1) * (N / 2)** or **O(N^2)**
- Other sorting algorithms involve more complex algorithms but faster execution
### Insertion Sort for Nearly Sorted Lists
- For sorted or nearly sorted inputs, insertion sort's runtime is **O(N)**
	- A **Nearly Sorted List** contains only a few elements not in sorted order such as
		- (4, 5, 17, 25, 89, 14) - Since only one element is not in the sorted position
- For each outer loop execution (*if the element is already in the sorted position*) only a single comparison is made
- Each element not in sorted position requires at most **N** comparisons
	- If there are a constant number **C** of unsorted elements, sorting the **N - C** sorted elements requires one comparison each
	- Sorting the **C** unsorted elements requires at most **N** comparisons each
- Runtime for nearly sorted inputs is **O((N - C) * 1 + C * N) = O(N)** 
### Python: Insertion Sort
- The `insertion_sort()` function has one parameter, numbers, which is an unsorted list of elements
- A list is a mutable object, so changes to numbers inside the function will all affect any variable that references the list
- The **Index** variable `i` denotes the starting position of the current element in the unsorted part
- Initially, the fist element (i.e. element at index 0) is assumed to be sorted
	- So the **Outer (for) Loop** assigns `i` with 1 to begin
	- The **Inner (while) Loop** inserts the current element into the sorted part be repeatedly swapping the current element with the elements in the sorted part that are larger
	- Once a smaller or equal element is found in sorted part, the current element has been inserted in the correct location and the while loop terminates.
##### Insertion Sort Algorithm in Python
```python
def insertion_sort(numbers):
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        j = i

        # Insert numbers[i] into sorted part 
        # stopping once numbers[i] in correct position
        while j > 0 and numbers[j] < numbers[j - 1]:
            # Swap numbers[j] and numbers[j - 1]
            temp = numbers[j]
            numbers[j] = numbers[j - 1]
            numbers[j - 1] = temp
            j -= 1
    
# Create a list of unsorted values    
numbers = [10, 2, 78, 4, 45, 32, 7, 11]

# Print unsorted list
print('UNSORTED:', numbers)

# Call the insertion_sort function
insertion_sort(numbers)

# Print sorted list
print('SORTED:', numbers)
```
- Output:
```
UNSORTED: [10, 2, 78, 4, 45, 32, 7, 11]
SORTED: [2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 32, 45, 78]
```
