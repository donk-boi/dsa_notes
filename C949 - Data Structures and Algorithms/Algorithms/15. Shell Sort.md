### Shell Sort
- **Shell Sort** is a sorting algorithm that treats the input as a collection of interleaved lists, and sorts each list individually with a variant of the insertion sort algorithm
- *Shell Sort* uses gap values to determine the number interleaved lists
	- A **Gap Value** is a positive integer representing the distance between elements in an interleaved list
	- For each interleaved list, if an element is at index `i` the next element is at index `i` + gap value
- Shell Sort begins by choosing gap value `K` and sorting `K` interleaved lists in place. 
- Shell sort finishes by performing a standard insertion sort on the entire array
	- Because the interleave parts have already been sorted, smaller elements will be close to the array's beginning and larger elements toward the end.
	- Insertion sort can then quickly sort the nearly sorted array.
- Any positive integer gap value can be chosen
- In the case that the array size is not evenly divisible by the gap value, some interleave lists will have fewer items than others
### Insertion Sort for Interleaved Lists
- If a *Gap Value* of `K` is chosen, creating `K` entirely new lists would be computationally expensive
- Instead of creating new lists, shell sort sorts interleaved lists in-place with a variation of the sort algorithm
- The insertion sort algorithm variant redefines the concept of **"next"** and **"previous"** items
	- For an item at index `X` the next item is at index `X + K` instead of `X + 1` 
	- For an item at index `X` the previous item is at index `X - K` instead of `X - 1`
### Shell Sort Algorithm
- Shell sort begins by picking an arbitrary collection of gap values
	- For each gap value `K`, `K` calls are made to the insertion sort variant function to sort `K` interleaved lists
	- Shell sort ends with a final gap value of 1 to finish with a regular insertion sort
- Shell sort tens to perform well when choosing gap values in descending order
	- A common option is to choose powers of 2 minus 1 in descending order
		- i.e. For an array size of 100, gap values would be 63, 31, 15, 7, 3, 1. This gap selection technique results in shell sort's time complexity being no worse than **O(N^3/2)**
- Using gap values that are powers of 2 or in descending order is not required
- Shell sort will correctly sort arrays using any positive integer gap values in any order, provided a gap value 1 is included
