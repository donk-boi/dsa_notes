### Quicksort and Partitioning
- **Quicksort** Is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly partitions the input into low and high parts (each unsorted) and then recursively sorts each of those parts
- To partition the input, quick sort chooses a pivot to divide the data into low and high parts
	- The **Pivot** can be any value within the array, commonly the middle array element
- To partition the input, the quick sort algorithm divides the array into two parts
	- **The Low Partition** All values are less than or equal to the pivot value
	- **The High Partition** All values are greater than or equal to the pivot value
	- The values in each partition are not necessarily sorted
- Values equal to the pivot may appear in either or both of the partitions
###### Example:
![[Pasted image 20250527220020.png]]
- The partitioning algorithm uses two index variables `l` and `h` (for low and high) initialized to the left and right sides of the current sorted elements
	- As long as the value at index `l` is less than the pivot value, the algorithm increments `l` because the element should remain in the low partition
	- As long as the value at index `h` is greater than the pivot value, the algorithm increments `h` because the element should remain in the high partition
- Then if  `l` >= `h` all the elements have been partitioned and the partitioning algorithm returns `h` which is the index of the last element in the low partition
- Otherwise, the elements at indices `l` and `h` are swapped to move those elements to the correct partitions
- The algorithm then increments `l` de-increments `h` and then repeats
### Quicksort Algorithm and Runtime
- Once partitioned, each partition needs to be sorted
- Quicksort is typically implemented as a recursive algorithm using calls to quicksort the low and high partitions
- This recursive sorting process continues until a partition has one or zero elements and thus us already sorted

##### The Recursive Quicksort Algorithm Including Its Key Component Partitioning Function
```python
def partition(numbers, i, k):
    #  Pick middle element as pivot 
    midpoint = i + (k - i) // 2
    pivot = numbers[midpoint]

    #  Initialize variables
    done = False
    l = i
    h = k
    while not done:
        #  Increment l while numbers[l] < pivot 
        while numbers[l] < pivot:
            l = l + 1
        #  Decrement h while pivot < numbers[h] 
        while pivot < numbers[h]:
            h = h - 1
        """  If there are zero or one items remaining,
              all numbers are partitioned. Return h """
        if l >= h:
            done = True
        else:
            """  Swap numbers[l] and numbers[h],
                  update l and h """ 
            temp = numbers[l]
            numbers[l] = numbers[h]
            numbers[h] = temp
            l = l + 1
            h = h - 1
    return h

def quicksort(numbers, i, k):
    j = 0
    """  Base case: If there are one or zero entries to sort,
          partition is already sorted  """ 
    if i >= k:
        return
    """  Partition the data within the array. Value j returned
          from partitioning is location of last item in low partition. """ 
    j = partition(numbers, i, k)
    """  Recursively sort low partition (i to j) and
          high partition (j + 1 to k) """
    quicksort(numbers, i, j)
    quicksort(numbers, j + 1, k)
    return

numbers = [10, 2, 78, 4, 45, 32, 7, 11]
print('UNSORTED:', end=' ')
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=' ')
print()

#  Initial call to quicksort 
quicksort(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1)
print('SORTED:', end=' ')
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=' ')
print()
```
- Output:
```
UNSORTED: 10 2 78 4 45 32 7 11 
SORTED: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 78
```
- The **Quicksort's Algorithm Runtime** is typically **O(N log N)** 
- Quicksort has several partitioning levels:
	- First level dividing the input into 2 parts
	- Second level dividing into 4 parts
	- Third level dividing into 8 parts
	- etc
- At each level, the algorithm does at most N comparisons moving the `i` and `h` indices
- If the pivot yields two equal sized parts, then there will be **log N** levels requiring the **N * log N** comparisons 
- For typical unsorted data, such equal partitioning occurs but partitioning may yield in unequal sized parts in some cases
	- If the pivot selected for partitioning is the smallest or largest element, one partition will have just one element and the other partition will have all other elements
	- If this unequal partitioning happens at every level there will be **N - 1** levels yielding in **(N - 1) * N** which is also **O(N^2)**
		- So the worst case runtime for the quicksort algorithm is **O(N^2)**
		- Fortunately, this worst case runtime rarely occurs

###### The `partition()` Function Used by Quicksort
```python
def partition(numbers, start_index, end_index):
    # Select the middle value as the pivot.
    midpoint = start_index + (end_index - start_index) // 2
    pivot = numbers[midpoint]
   
    # "low" and "high" start at the ends of the list segment
    # and move towards each other.
    low = start_index
    high = end_index
   
    done = False
    while not done:
        # Increment low while numbers[low] < pivot
        while numbers[low] < pivot:
            low = low + 1
      
        # Decrement high while pivot < numbers[high]
        while pivot < numbers[high]:
            high = high - 1
      
        # If low and high have crossed each other, the loop
        # is done. If not, the elements are swapped, low is
        # incremented and high is decremented.
        if low >= high:
            done = True
        else:
            temp = numbers[low]
            numbers[low] = numbers[high]
            numbers[high] = temp
            low = low + 1
            high = high - 1
   
    # "high" is the last index in the left segment.
    return high
```
