### Selection Sort Algorithms 
- **Selection Sort** is a sorting algorithm that treats the inputs as two parts
	- **Sorted and Unsorted**
- and then repeatedly selects the proper next value to move from the unsorted part to the end of the sorted part
##### Selection Sort Visualized

- The index variable `i` denotes the dividing point
	- Elements to the left of `i` are sorted
	- Elements to the right of and including `i` are unsorted
- All elements in the unsorted part of searched to find the index of the element with the smallest value
- The variable `index_smallest` stores the index of the smallest element in the unsorted part
- Once the element with the smallest value is found, that element is swapped with the element at location `i`
- Then the index `i` is advances one place to the right and the process repeats
### Advantages to Selection Sort
- Selection Sort has advantages of being east to code, involving one loop nested within another loop as shown below:
##### Selection Sort Algorithm
```python
def selection_sort(numbers):
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        # Find index of smallest remaining element
        index_smallest = i
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            if numbers[j] < numbers[index_smallest]:
                index_smallest = j
    
        # Swap numbers[i] and numbers[index_smallest]
        temp = numbers[i]
        numbers[i] = numbers[index_smallest]
        numbers[index_smallest] = temp

            
numbers = [10, 2, 78, 4, 45, 32, 7, 11]
print('UNSORTED:', end=' ')
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=' ')
print()

selection_sort(numbers)
print('SORTED:', end=' ')
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=' ')
print()
```
- output:
```
UNSORTED: 10 2 78 4 45 32 7 11 
SORTED: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 78
```
- Selection Sort may require a large number of comparisons
- The selection sort runtime is **O(N^2)**
	- If a list has N elements, the outer loop executes **N - 1** times 
	- For each of those **N - 1** outer loop executions, the inner loop executes an average of **N / 2** times
	- So the total number of comparisons is proportional to **(N - 1) * N / 2** or **O(N^2)** 
- Other sorting algorithms involve more complex algorithms but have much faster execution times
### Python: Selection Sort
- The `selection_sort()` function takes the list as a parameter and has no return value since the list is sorted in place by the algorithm
- The outer loop uses the variable `i` to hold the index position that will be sorted next in the list
- The inner loop used the variable `j` to examine all indices from `i + 1` to the end of the list
- When the `j` loop finishes the variable `index_smallest` will store the index position of the smallest item in the list from `i` onward
- The final step is to swap the values at position `i` and `index_smallest`
##### Python Selection Sort Code
```python
def selection_sort(numbers):
   for i in range(len(numbers)-1):
      
      # Find index of smallest remaining element
      index_smallest = i
      for j in range(i+1, len(numbers)):
         
         if numbers[j] < numbers[index_smallest]:
            index_smallest = j
      
      # Swap numbers[i] and numbers[index_smallest]
      temp = numbers[i]
      numbers[i] = numbers[index_smallest]
      numbers[index_smallest] = temp
```
##### Python Program to Test Selection Sort
```python
# Create a list of numbers to sort
numbers = [10, 2, 78, 4, 45, 32, 7, 11]

# Display the contents of the list
print('UNSORTED:', numbers)

# Call the selection_sort() function
selection_sort(numbers)

# Display the (sorted) contents of the list
print('SORTED:', numbers)
```
- which would output
```
UNSORTED: [10, 2, 78, 4, 45, 32, 7, 11]
SORTED: [2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 32, 45, 78]
```
