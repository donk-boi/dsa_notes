### Recurrence Relations
- The runtime complexity T(N) of a recursive function will have function T on both sides of the equation
	- i.e. the [[Recursive Binary Search Algorithm]] performs constant time operations then a recursive call that operations on half of the input, making the runtime complexity T(N) = O(1) + T(N / 2) 
	- Such a function is known as **Recurrence Relation** which is a function f(N) that is defined in terms of the same function operation on a value < N
- Using [[5. O Notation]] to express runtime complexity of a recursive function requires solving the recurrence relation.
	- For simpler recursive functions such as binary search, runtime complexity can be determined by expressing the number of function calls as function of N

### Recursion Trees
- The runtime complexity of any recursive function can be split into 2 part:
	- Operations done directly by the function
	- Operations done by recursive calls made by the function
		- i.e. or binary search's T(N) = O(1) + T(N / 2), O(1) represents operations directly done by the function and T(N / 2) represents operation done by a recursive call.
- A useful tool for solving recurrences is a **Recursion Tree**
	- A visual diagram of an operation done by a recursive function, that separates operations done directly by the function and operations done by recursive calls
