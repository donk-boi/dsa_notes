### Examples of Recursive Algorithms
#### Fibonacci Sequence
- The ****Fibonacci Sequence** is a numerical sequence where each term is the sum of the previous 2 terms in the sequence except for the first 2 terms which are 0 and 1*
	- A *Recursive Function* can be used to calculate the Fibonacci Number or a *term in the Fibonacci Sequence*

#### Recursive Binary Search
- A **Binary Search** is an algorithm that searches a sorted list for a key by first comparing the key to the middle element in the list and recursively searching half of the remaining so long as the key is not found
- Binary Search first checks the middle element of the list
- If the search key is found, the algorithm returns the index
- If the search key is not found, the algorithm recursively searches the remaining left or right sub-lists
