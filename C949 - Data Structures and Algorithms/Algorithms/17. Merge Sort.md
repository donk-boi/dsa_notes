### Merge Sort and Partitioning
- **Merge Sort** is a sorting algorithm that divides the list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a sorted list
- This recursive partitioning continues until a list of one element is reached, *as a list of one element is already sorted*
###### Merge Sort Visualized

- The *Merge Sort* algorithm uses three index variables to keep track of the elements to sort for each recursive call.
	- The index variable `i` is the index of the first element in the list
	- The index variable `k` is the index of the last element
	- The index variable `j` is used to divide the list into two halves
- Elements from `i` to `j` are in the left half and elements from `j + 1` are in the right half
### Merge Sort Algorithm
- Merge sort merges the two sorted partitions into a single list by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from either the left or right partition and adding that element to a temporary merged list.
- nce fully merged, the elements in the temporary merged list are copied back to the original list.

##### Merge Sort Algorithm Code
```python
def merge(numbers, i, j, k):
    merged_size = k - i + 1   #  Size of merged partition
    merged_numbers = []        #  Temporary list for merged numbers
    for l in range(merged_size):
        merged_numbers.append(0)
        
    merge_pos = 0      #  Position to insert merged number
    
    left_pos = i       #  Initialize left partition position
    right_pos = j + 1  #  Initialize right partition position
    
    #  Add smallest element from left or right partition to merged numbers
    while left_pos <= j and right_pos <= k:
        if numbers[left_pos] <= numbers[right_pos]:
            merged_numbers[merge_pos] = numbers[left_pos]
            left_pos = left_pos + 1
        else:
            merged_numbers[merge_pos] = numbers[right_pos]
            right_pos = right_pos + 1
        merge_pos = merge_pos + 1

    #  If left partition is not empty, add remaining elements to merged numbers
    while left_pos <= j:
        merged_numbers[merge_pos] = numbers[left_pos]
        left_pos = left_pos + 1
        merge_pos = merge_pos + 1

    #  If right partition is not empty, add remaining elements to merged numbers
    while right_pos <= k:
        merged_numbers[merge_pos] = numbers[right_pos]
        right_pos = right_pos + 1
        merge_pos = merge_pos + 1

    #  Copy merge number back to numbers
    merge_pos = 0
    while merge_pos < merged_size:
        numbers[i + merge_pos] = merged_numbers[merge_pos]
        merge_pos = merge_pos + 1

def merge_sort(numbers, i, k):
    j = 0
    if i < k:
        j = (i + k) // 2  #  Find the midpoint in the partition
        
        #  Recursively sort left and right partitions
        merge_sort(numbers, i, j)
        merge_sort(numbers, j + 1, k)
        
        #  Merge left and right partition in sorted order
        merge(numbers, i, j, k)
  
          
numbers = [10, 2, 78, 4, 45, 32, 7, 11]
print("UNSORTED:", end=" ")
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=" ")
print()

#  initial call to merge_sort with index 
merge_sort(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1)
print("SORTED:", end=" ")
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=" ")
print()
```
- Output:
```
  UNSORTED: 10 2 78 4 45 32 7 11 
  SORTED: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 78
```
### Merge Sort Runtime
- The merge sort algorithm's runtime is **O(N log N).**
	- Merge sort divides the input in half until a list of one element is reached, which requires **log N** partitioning levels. At each level, the algorithm does about N comparisons selecting and copying elements from the left and right partitions, yielding **N * log N* comparisons.
- Merge sort requires **O(N)** additional memory elements for the temporary array of merged elements. For the final merge operation, the temporary list has the same number of elements as the input. Some sorting algorithms sort the list elements in place and require no additional memory but are more complex to write and understand.

### Merge Sort Algorithm in Python
- **Merge Sort** uses 2 functions
	- `merge()` **which merges 2 sequential sorted partitions within a list and has 4 parameters:**
		- 1st The list of numbers containing the 2 sorted partitions to merge
		- 2nd The start index of the first sorted partition
		- 3rd The end index of the first sorted partition
		- 4th The end index of the second sorted partition
	- `merge_sort()` **which sorts a partition in a list and has 3 parameters:**
		- 1st The list containing the partition to sort
		- 2nd The start index of the partition to sort
		- 3rd The end index of the partition to sort
- If the partition size is **greater than 1** the `merge_sort()` function recursively sorts the left and right halves then merges the sorted halves together
	- When the index is 0 and the end is the the list length minus 1, `merge_sort()` sorts the entire list

    # Copy merge number back to numbers
    for merge_pos in range(merged_size):

def merge_sort(numbers, i, k):
    j = 0

    if i < k:

        # Recursively sort left and right partitions

        merge(numbers, i, j, k)

# Create a list of unsorted values
