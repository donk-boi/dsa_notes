### Algorithms and Linear Search
- An **Algorithm** is a sequence of steps for accomplishing a task
- **Linear Search** is a search algorithm that starts from the beginning of a list and checks each element until the search key is found or the end of the list is reached
#### Linear Search Algorithm in Python:
```python
def linear_search(numbers, key):
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] == key:
            return i
    return -1   # not found

numbers = [2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 32, 45, 87]
print('NUMBERS:', end=' ')
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=' ')
print()

key = int(input('Enter a value: '))
key_index = linear_search(numbers, key)

if key_index == -1:
    print(f'{key} was not found.')
else:
    print(f'Found {key} at index {key_index}.')
```
- The output:
```
NUMBERS: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 87 Enter a value: 10 Found 10 at index 3. ... NUMBERS: 2 4 7 10 11 32 45 87 Enter a value: 17 17 was not found.
```
### Algorithm Runtime
- An algorithm's **Runtime** is the time that the algorithm takes to execute.
- If each comparison takes 1 microsecond, a *Linear Search* algorithm's runtime is up to 1 second to search a list with 1 million elements, 10 seconds for 10 million elements, and so on.
	- Searching Amazon's webstore, which has more than 200 million items, could require more than 3 minutes
- An algorithm typically uses a number of steps proportional to the size of the input.
	- For a list of 32 elements, linear search requires at most 32 comparisons. 1 comparison if the key is found at index 0, 2 if found at index 1 and up to 32 if the search key is not found.
		- For a list with N elements, linear search requires at most N comparisons.
		- The algorithm is said to require approximately N comparisons
