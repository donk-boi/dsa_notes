### Fast Sorting Algorithm
- A **Fast Sorting Algorithm** is a sorting algorithm that has an average runtime complexity of O(NlogN) or better.

### Comparison Sorting 
- A **Element Comparison Sorting Algorithm** is a sorting algorithm that operates on an array of elements that can be compared to each other.
	- i.e. An array of strings can be sorted with a comparison sorting algorithm, since two strings can be compared to determine if one string is less than, equal to, or greater than another string
- *Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Heap Sort* are all **Comparison Sorting Algorithms
- Radix Sort, in contrast, sub-divides each array element into integer digits and is not a comparison sorting algorithm

### Best and Worst Case Runtime Complexity
- A Fast Sorting Algorithm's best or worst case runtime complexity may differ from the average runtime complexity
	- i.e. The best and average case runtime complexity for *Quick Sort* is **O(NlogN),** but the worst case is **O(N^2)**
