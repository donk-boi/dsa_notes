### Bubble Sort
- **Bubble Sort** is a sorting algorithm that iterates through a list comparing and swapping adjacent elements if the second element is less than the first element
- Bubble sort uses nested loops
- Given a list with **N** elements, the outer loop `i` iterates **N - 1** times
	- Each iteration moves the i-th largest element into sorted position
- The inner loop `j` iterates through all adjacent pairs, comparing and swapping adjacent elements as needed
	- **Except for the last `i` pairs that are already in the correct position**
### Bubble Sort Algorithm Runtime Complexity
- Because of the nested loops, the bubble sort has a runtime of **O(N^2)** 
	- Bubble sort is often considered *impractical* for real-world use because many faster sorting algorithms exist
